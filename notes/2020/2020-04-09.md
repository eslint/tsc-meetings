## Topics

### [Optional chaining ESTRee representation](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/171#issuecomment-611261529)

* @nzakas: I’d like to discuss [estree/estree#204](https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/204) to see if we can come to a consensus recommendation from ESLint and move it forward.
* The question is whether we would like to adopt @mysticatea’s representation of optional property access and function calls or if we would like to adopt what Babel already uses.
* Coming to a single position as a team would move discussion along.
* The simplest solution would accept the Babel approach, following other projects.
* @mysticatea [summarized different options](https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/204#issuecomment-602387966) in the pull request.
* The Babel approach would require ESLint to use `MemberExpression, OptionalMemberExpression[optional=false]` and `CallExpression, OptionalCallExpression[optional=false]` everywhere, whereas only `Optional(Member|Call)Expression[optional=true]` refers to actually-optional expressions.
* @nzakas and @btmills would prefer the `Optional(Member|Call)Expression` approach if it didn't have the `optional` property, but @mysticatea [explained in the pull request](https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/204#issuecomment-593918577) that disambiguating `obj?.aaa.bbb` and `(obj?.aaa).bbb` in the absence of an `optional` property would require [adding a `ChainingExpression` node](https://gist.github.com/mysticatea/f3a87f3e02632797ec59d9b447fdf05e).
* @btmills asks if the existing implementations of the Babel proposal in the wild mean it's too late to have an effect were the ESLint team to decide to support the `optional`/`shortCircuited` proposal. Not seeing one clearly superior proposal without significant downshides, should we then go with the devil we know?
* @nzakas thinks something similar to `ChainingExpression` is the answer given that Babel is willing to change based on the ESTree discussion but people are generally against adding new properties to `MemberExpression` and `CallExpression`.
* @btmills feels that @mysticatea's [`ChainingExpression` proposal](https://gist.github.com/mysticatea/f3a87f3e02632797ec59d9b447fdf05e) has fewer opportunities for mistakes than boolean flags on nodes.
* @nzakas would support `ChainingExpression` so long as it doesn't replace the existing `MemberExpression` and `CallExpression` nodes in a breaking change. @btmills agrees.
* @mysticatea is OK with adding `ChainingExpression` without replacing existing nodes to avoid a breaking change.

**Resolution**: ESLint, as a team, will back @mysticatea's [`ChainingExpression` proposal](https://gist.github.com/mysticatea/f3a87f3e02632797ec59d9b447fdf05e) without replacing existing nodes. @mysticatea will update [estree/estree#204]((https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/204)), and @nzakas [left a comment clarifying the team's position](https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/204#issuecomment-611748141).

### [[WIP] Update: Add ESLint API (refs eslint/rfcs#40)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12939)

* This is the last change before the final v7.0.0 alpha release.
* @kaicataldo joined the meeting to give an update on its status.
* The bulk of the remaining work is porting over the existing `CLIEngine` tests, which will start fresh since some `CLIEngine` PRs have been merged since starting.
* We need to clarify some default values for constructor options that currently override config file options.

**Resolution**: The rest of the team can see about tackling some of the work this weekend or next week if @kaicataldo isn't feeling up to continuing.

### [Scheduled release for April 10th, 2020](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13113)

* This release will not happen on its scheduled date while we work to finish https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12939.

### Additional items

* @btmills has updated the Markdown plugin and its docs to the new processor API and plans to do an alpha release this weekend.
* @nzakas is working on organizing the ESTree project and getting it moving again.
