## Topics

### [ESLint v7 RC release](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13217)

* [Update: Add ESLint API (refs eslint/rfcs#40)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12939) is the last remaining item in the [v7 project](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/projects/6).
* Thanks to @mysticatea for finishing it up to unblock the release.
* @btmills and @kaicataldo will review it today so we can merge it for release tomorrow.
* @kaicataldo suggests skipping a beta and moving straight to a release candidate because we will be feature complete. :+1: from @btmills.
* @mysticatea points out that we skipped `6.0.0-beta.*`, so we already have precedent.
* @kaicataldo volunteered to run the release tomorrow.

**Resolution**: @btmills and @kaicataldo will review the PR so we can merge it in time for @kaicataldo to do our first RC release tomorrow.

### [ESLint v7 migration guide](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12692)

* @mysticatea astutely points out that we need to finish the v7 migration guide.
* @kaicataldo does not feel it should block the release, but it should become the top priority after finishing [Update: Add ESLint API (refs eslint/rfcs#40)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12939).
* @mysticatea does not have time to finish the migration guide this weekend, but the rest of the team can work on it before then.
