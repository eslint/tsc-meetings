## Topics

### [Limiting TSC size](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/167#issuecomment-596670119)

* @nzakas: I'd like to discuss limiting the size of the TSC. Part of the trouble late last year and early this year was because we couldn't get consensus due to people not participating much. I'd like to propose that we limit the TSC to no more than five people at any point in time.
* :+1: from @kaicataldo and @btmills

**Resolution**: We will limit the size of the TSC to 5 members, and @nzakas volunteered to update the docs accordingly.

### [Eliminating non-attending TSC status](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/167#issuecomment-596670119)

* @nzakas: I'd also like to propose that we eliminate the non-attending status. We reached a point last year where a majority of TSC members were non-attending, and I don't think that's sustainable. Being available for meetings and actively participating seems like a minimum bar for remaining on the TSC and ensuring the project has good leadership.
* @kaicataldo is in favor and asks about a policy for missing meetings, though we could play it by ear because we're a small team.
* @btmills is also in favor now that we have precedent from people moving to the alumni team.
* @nzakas references the [Node.js TSC attendance policy](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/TSC-Charter.md):

	> In the case where an individual TSC member -- within any three month period -- attends fewer than 25% of the regularly scheduled meetings, does not participate in TSC discussions, and does not participate in TSC votes, the member shall be automatically removed from the TSC. The member may be invited to continue attending TSC meetings as an observer.

* For reference, the [Node.js TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/node#tsc-technical-steering-committee) is much larger.
* @btmills views the Node.js policy as allowing them to remove someone who's not around without the awkward gray area.
* @kaicataldo is concerned about putting TSC members in the awkward position of having to tease out whether someone has reached that threshold.
* @btmills and @kaicataldo both feel that the small TSC is less likely to encounter an issue.
* @nzakas proposes a policy where a TSC member who misses four consecutive meetings would be moved to the Reviewer team. They can be re-nominated to the TSC if the situation changes again.
* :+1: from @kaicataldo and @btmills.

**Resolution**: @nzakas will update the docs to reflect the 4-meeting policy.

### [Scheduled release for March 13th, 2020](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12983)

**Resolution**: @kaicataldo will do the release. It may be delayed somewhat as discussed in the next section.

### [ESLint v7.0.0 status](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/projects/6)

* @kaicataldo is continuing to work on [Update: Add ESLint API (refs eslint/rfcs#40)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12939). Converting `CLIEngine` tests to the `ESLint` API is the most time-consuming part.
* [Update: deprecate Node.js & CommonJS rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12898) will be unblocked once @mysticatea releases `eslint-plugin-node`, which should happen this weekend.
* [Breaking: support globalThis (refs #12670)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12774), [Breaking: change relative paths with --config (refs eslint/rfcs#37)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12887), and [Breaking: improve plugin resolving (refs eslint/rfcs#47)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12922) are ready for review.
	* @nzakas would like to get these into the next release if possible.
	* TSC members should review these outside the meeting before this weekend.
	* @kaicataldo was planning to do the release on Friday but will delay until those three PRs are ready.
* [no-else-return rule should work in try-catch block](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11678) is the last issue waiting to be implemented.
	* It does not currently have a clear direction.
	* @kaicataldo proposes deferring it and removing it from the v7.0.0 project.
	* :+1: from @btmills and @nzakas.
