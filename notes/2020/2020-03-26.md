## Topics

### [Investigate switching from Gitter to another chat option](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13039)

* **TSC Summary**: Gitter has become unreliable (this affected our last TSC meeting), and @nzakas and I have been looking into Discord. It allows us to have unlimited messages for free and has become the home for a number of OSS communities. The only thing missing is the ability to point to a meeting transcript, but it seems doable using Discord's APIs and so shouldn't be a blocker.
* **TSC Question**: Do we want to move our private team chats to Discord to try it out? If we like it, we can then move our public chats as well.
* By "private chats", that means the `eslint/tsc` and `eslint` chats.
* :+1: from @btmills, @kaicataldo, @mysticatea.

**Resolution**: We'll move the `eslint/tsc` and `eslint` chats to Discord to test out the system, and @nzakas will take the action item and send out invites to everyone.

### [ESLint v7 status](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/projects/6)

* For reference, we discussed this in [the previous meeting as well](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/blob/master/notes/2020/2020-03-12.md#eslint-v700-status).
* [Support globalThis](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12670)
	* [Update: support globalThis (refs #12670)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12774) was merged last week.
	* [Update: consider env in no-implied-eval (fixes #12733)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12757) was also merged last week. It will need [one more update to support globalThis](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12757/files#diff-d0cebbf38108d050e5324fac78c15ec2R39) before we can close the issue.
	* @btmills will ask in the issue if the original author would like to submit that last change.
* [Update: deprecate Node.js & CommonJS rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12898)
	* This is waiting on a release of `eslint-plugin-node`.
	* We could instead wait to add `replacedBy` in a later release so that we can merge it now.
* [Breaking: improve plugin resolving (refs eslint/rfcs#47)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12922)
	* This has been rebased on `master` since [Breaking: change relative paths with --config (refs eslint/rfcs#37)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12887) was merged and should be easier to review.
	* @mysticatea will fix a lint issue.
* [Breaking: RuleTester Improvements (refs eslint/rfcs#25)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12955)
	* This is ready for review.
* [Update: Add ESLint API (refs eslint/rfcs#40)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12939)
	* @kaicataldo continues to work on porting the tests over to the new API.

### [Scheduled release for March 13th, 2020](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12983) and [March 27th, 2020](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13101)

* We [decided in the previous meeting](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/blob/master/notes/2020/2020-03-12.md#scheduled-release-for-march-13th-2020) to hold this release until the v7 PRs were merged. That didn't happen, so this release hasn't gone out yet.
* @kaicataldo is available for a release tomorrow.

**Resolution**: TSC members should review the remaining v7 PRs so that @kaicataldo can run a mostly-complete release tomorrow.
