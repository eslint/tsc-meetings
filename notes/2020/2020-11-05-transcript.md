# 11/05/2020 ESLint TSC Meeting Transcript

**btmills:** 👋

**mdjermanovic:** Hi

**btmills:** It ain't looking good. Give @mysticatea and @kaicataldo another 5 minutes?

**mdjermanovic:** Sure!

**btmills:** In the meantime, https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13645 was the only non-release issue on the agenda, but you and I have both already left a 👍, so nothing to do there.

**btmills:** I'm not available for the release this weekend, so unless you are, we'll have to try to figure it out on the issue thread https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13804

**mdjermanovic:** I'm not sure if we have anything merged or ready-to-merge this time

**btmills:** Good point. We could maybe get something there, but unless somebody volunteers I think we can reasonably skip this weekend

**btmills:** All right, calling it. I'll go ahead and close the meeting issue and add a note to the release issue
 * 👍 @mdjermanovic
