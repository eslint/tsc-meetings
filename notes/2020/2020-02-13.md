Additionally, the following individuals are not in attendance but support consensus:

* Kai Cataldo (@kaicataldo) - TSC

@nzakas moderated, and @btmills took notes and updated issues with resolutions.

## Topics

* The goal for this meeting is to plan what goes in v7.0.0.
* We will not add anything new to v7.0.0 after this meeting.
* To save time, we'll only decide here whether to include something in v7.0.0 or leave it for later discussion after this release.

### [Handling warnings/errors for configuration and other non-rule issues](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12650)

* There has been follow-up discussion since the TSC Question was originally posted.
* @kaicataldo reopened the issue after it was auto-closed, so @nzakas suggests deferring until @kaicataldo is able to update the TSC Question.
* https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/34 has a possible dependency on this, so we'll circle back to this if necessary.

**Resolution**: Deferring until @kaicataldo is available.

### Updates to `eslint:recommended`

* Of 9 new rules since v6, @mysticatea suggests adding `no-import-assign`, `prefer-regex-literals`, `grouped-accessor-pairs`, `no-setter-return`, and `no-dupe-else-if` to `eslint:recommended`.
* :+1: from @nzakas and @btmills on `no-import-assign`, `no-setter-return` and `no-dupe-else-if`.
* :-1: from @nzakas and @btmills on `prefer-regex-literals` and `grouped-accessor-pairs` because they aren't technically problems.

**Resolution**: @nzakas opened [#12911](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12911) to add `no-import-assign`, `no-setter-return`, and `no-dupe-else-if` to `eslint:recommended`.

### [Change default value for enforceForClassMembers in computed-property-spacing](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12812)

* This would make sure the defaults are the same in classes as they are in objects.
* @kaicataldo and @mysticatea left :+1:s on the issue.
* :+1: from @btmills and @mysticatea.

**Resolution**: Accepted for v7.0.0.

### [Change default value for enforceForSwitchCase in use-isnan](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12810)

* @kaicataldo and @mysticatea left :+1:s on the issue.
* :+1: from @btmills and @mysticatea.

**Resolution**: Accepted for v7.0.0.

### [Change default value for enforceForClassMembers in accessor-pairs](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12811)

* @kaicataldo and @mysticatea left :+1:s on the issue.
* :+1: from @btmills and @mysticatea.

**Resolution**: Accepted for v7.0.0.

### [New: Lint files in parallel if many files exist](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/42)

* @btmills, @nzakas, and @mysticatea agree that there's too much left to do to include this in v7.0.0.
* @mysticatea notes that portions of the RFC can be implemented in semver-minor releases after v7.0.0, so we don't need to wait for v8.0.0.

**Resolution**: Do this after v7.0.0.

### [Update: Check for unknown error object keys in RuleTester](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12096) and [Update: RuleTester Improvements](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/25)

* The RFC incorporates the changes made in the pull request, so a decision on the RFC would answer both questions.
* The RFC has been in final commenting, so including it in v7.0.0 would not push back the release.
* @mysticatea authored the RFC.
* @btmills has already approved the RFC.
* @nzakas is okay merging the RFC based on existing approving reviews from the rest of the team.

**Resolution**: @mysticatea merged the RFC, and the pull request is therefore also accepted.

### [enable no-use-before-define in eslint:recommended](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11903)

* There's still ongoing discussion about this change, and it may be split into a TDZ-specific proposal.
* Given that, @nzakas, @btmills, and @mysticatea are all :-1: to including this in v7.0.0

**Resolution**: Don't include this in v7.0.0.

### [Stricter `no-undef` default](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10203)

* There's some disagreement on the issue with 2 :+1:s and 4 :-1:s.
* @mysticatea still believes `no-undef` should report `typeof` as well.
* :+1: from @btmills, @nzakas, and @mysticatea to leaving this for after v7.0.0.

**Resolution**: Don't include this in v7.0.0.

### [Validate options passed to CLIEngine API](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10272)

* Moving over to the new `ESLint` class could make this obsolete.
* :+1: from @nzakas, @btmills, and @mysticatea to leaving this for after v7.0.0.

**Resolution**: Don't include this in v7.0.0.

### [remove no-useless-escape from eslint:recommended](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11922)

* :-1: from @nzakas, @btmills, and @mysticatea to including this in v7.0.0.

**Resolution**: Don't include this in v7.0.0.

### [Update: fix func-names for unnamed export default (fixes #12194)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12195)

* In https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12194, we already accepted this as a bug fix, but we classified it as a semver-major change because it's possibly disruptive.

**Resolution**: Add it to the v7.0.0 release project for tracking.

### [Breaking: no-dupe-class-members checks some computed keys (fixes #12808)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12837)

* In https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12808, we already accepted this as a bug fix, but we classified it as a semver-major change because it's possibly disruptive.

**Resolution**: Add it to the v7.0.0 release project for tracking.

### [New: Allow All Directives in Line Comments](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/34)

* This potentially depends on https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12650, which we decided at the beginning of the meeting to defer.
* We could decide to accept the process change that would allow us to handle this on a case-by-case basis.
* @nzakas prefers to keep the v7.0.0 scope as small as we can, so we shouldn't include this in v7.0.0 if we don't have to.
* The long-term solution described in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12650 would require an RFC, so it's definitely not something that would be ready in time for v7.0.0.
* :+1: from @btmills and @mysticatea to not including this in v7.0.0.

**Resolution**: Don't include this in v7.0.0.
