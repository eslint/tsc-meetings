**mysticatea:** Hello.

**kaicataldo:** Hi all 👋

**kaicataldo:** I'm happy to facilitate the meeting

**btmills:** I'll take notes

**kaicataldo:** It looks like the only thing we have on the agenda is the release for tomorrow (which I can run)

**kaicataldo:** Is there anything either of you would like to discuss?

**mysticatea:** Nothing from me.

**btmills:** Nothing here either

**kaicataldo:** @btmills Are you able to review @mysticatea's PR for the new syntax?

**kaicataldo:** I'd love to get that in the release tomorrow!

**btmills:** I'll do that with the time I'm about to get back 👍

**kaicataldo:** Much appreciated 🎉

**kaicataldo:** In that case, I believe the meeting is done. @mysticatea So sorry that you woke up for this. Going forward, maybe we can decide the day before if we should have the meeting or not when we have nothing on the agenda.

**kaicataldo:** Thanks all 👋

**btmills:** 👋

**mysticatea:** No problem. Thank you 👋
