## Topics

### [Website redesign update](https://new.eslint.org/)

* Proxying from `/docs` and `/play` to separate sites is working well.
* @nzakas [switched](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/15890) metadata fetching from build-time to a data file generated on precommit to speed up builds and allow manual tweaks.
* A new [deploy workflow](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/15894) only publishes the site on releases.
* The docs site UI isn't the latest from Sara, so @nzakas needs to update it from an older commit.
* Integrating the main site's Google Analytics and Carbon Ads codes into the docs site will come next.
* We'll need to update all the docs to use new formats for further reading and related rules links, Version and Resources sections, and recommended/fixable/suggestions info.

### [Scheduled release for May 20th, 2022](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15858)

* @mdjermanovic can do the release.
* It will include `@eslint/eslintrc` and `eslint`.
* If the new docs site workflow successfully deploys along with the release, [https://new.eslint.org/docs](https://new.eslint.org/docs) will show the new version number.
* @mdjermanovic has two PRs up that @nzakas will check out.

**Resolution:** @mdjermanovic will release `@eslint/eslintrc` and `eslint`.
