## Topics

### Espree types

* We have two PRs both seeking to provide builtin TypeScript declarations with `espree`, and we need to decide how to proceed.
* [#530, docs: added JS doc comments and tsconfig](https://github.com/eslint/espree/pull/530) by @srijan-paul is simpler because it only generates type declarations.
* [#544, feat: Programmatic building of type-checkable JS and declaration files](https://github.com/eslint/espree/pull/544) by @brettz9 additionally enables type checking in the source code.
* @nzakas asks if the two are compatible. Per @mdjermanovic, there would likely be slight differences, so if we merged #530 first, #544 would have to be updated to match.
* Since enabling type checking might catch incompatibilities, @btmills would rather have it enabled before publishing type declarations.
* @nzakas sees little value in merging #530 separately from #544.
* Since @brettz9 is actively working on #544, @nzakas proposes sticking with that one and paying @srijan-paul for work to date on #530. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.

**Resolution**: Move forward with #544. Pay @srijan-paul for work on #530.

### [Website redesign update](https://new.eslint.org/)

* We now have multiple translated sites: https://es.eslint.org/, https://ja.eslint.org/, https://hi.eslint.org/, and https://new.cn.eslint.org/.
* @nzakas is working on getting the playground working from `/play`.
* The docs site was merged into the main eslint repository, and @nzakas will continue working on it so maybe we can start using it in two weeks.
* We still need to figure out how the version dropdown will work.
* We still need to get cn.eslint.org transitioned to the new format and set up on the new docs site.

* @mdjermanovic suggests $300 for @captbaritone given the size of the PR and agrees with the other amounts. :+1: from @btmills and @nzakas.

### [Scheduled release for May 6th, 2022](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15805)

* @mdjermanovic can do the release.
* It will include `espree`, `@eslint/eslintrc` for its dependency on `espree`, and `eslint`.

**Resolution:** @mdjermanovic will release `@eslint/eslintrc`, `espree`, and `eslint`.

### Reminder to watch website repositories

* @nzakas reminds everyone to watch the [new.eslint.org](https://github.com/eslint/new.eslint.org) and [play.eslint.org](https://github.com/eslint/play.eslint.org) repositories because PRs there aren't getting any attention.
