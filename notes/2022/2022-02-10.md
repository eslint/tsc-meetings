* Nicholas C. Zakas (@nzakas) - TSC
* Brandon Mills (@btmills) - TSC

@nzakas moderated, and @btmills took notes.

## Topics

### [new.eslint.org](https://new.eslint.org)

* @nzakas will flip [new.eslint.org](https://new.eslint.org) live after the meeting.
* We should have the homepage animation next week.
* @nzakas is working on pulling live sponsor data during build time.

### Open RFCs

* @nzakas would like to move two RFCs to final commenting soon:
    1. [feat!: Require schemas and object-style rules](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/85)
	2. [feat!: Stricter rule test validation](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/84)
* @nzakas has already approved both.
* @btmills and @mdjermanovic will try to review both in the next week.

### [[feature] Add custom `data` into `LintMessage`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14198)

* There was another comment on this issue recently that brought up a second potential use case.
* @btmills plans to tackle this before diving into TypeScript annotation work.
* It originally felt adjacent to [Allow processor API to be configurable and to formally be able to lint both a file and its blocks](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14745), but they're separate use cases.

### SWC

* @bartlomieju is looking to see if there's a way for ESLint to use [SWC](https://rustdoc.swc.rs/swc_estree_compat/) (the Rust JavaScript parser that Deno uses).
* Options include NAPI or wasm, though wasm would require async parsing.
* @mdjermanovic plans to make a working prototype and then start the RFC for async `parse()`.

### [Scheduled release for February 11th, 2022](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15554)

* @mdjermanovic volunteers for the release.
* `espree`, `eslint-scope`, `eslintrc`, possibly `eslint-visitor-keys`, and `eslint` all need to be released.

**Resolution:** @mdjermanovic will release just about everything.
