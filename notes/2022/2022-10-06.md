## Topics

### [eslint-community](https://github.com/eslint-community) update

* We have the final logo! @nzakas already updated the GitHub organization to use it, and Hayden gave us a few alternatives that we can use wherever appropriate.
* Expect a formal announcement blog post soonish.

### [Documentation update](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16365)

* Ben Perlmutter has [a tracking issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16365) and is starting with some smaller tasks to build familiarity.

### [Contributor Pool](https://github.com/issues?q=org%3Aeslint+label%3A%22contributor+pool%22+merged%3A2022-09-01..2022-10-06)

* There are [four PRs](https://github.com/issues?q=org%3Aeslint+label%3A%22contributor+pool%22+merged%3A2022-09-01..2022-10-06) that were already tagged.
* @btmills nominates nschoni for the aggregate of [a handful of docs PRs](https://github.com/issues?q=org%3Aeslint+author%3Anschonni+merged%3A2022-09-01..2022-10-06+). :+1: from @mdjermanovic and @nzakas.
* @nzakas proposes $200 for sosukesuzuki and dmartens, $150 for nschonni, and $100 for ZLY201.
* @mdjermanovic proposes $300 for dmartens because the new rule took a lot of work and agrees with the rest. :+1: from @btmills and @nzakas.

**Resolution:** @nzakas will reach out to award $300 to dmartens, $200 to sosukesuzuki, $150 to nschonni, and $100 to ZLY201.

### [Scheduled release for October 7th, 2022](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16351)

* @mdjermanovic volunteers for the release.
* @btmills will finish changes on [feat: Pass --max-warnings value to formatters](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/16348) in time for the release.
* @nzakas has an [eslintrc README update](https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc/pull/92), so we should release `eslintrc` too to update the README on mpm.

**Resolution:** @mdjermanovic will release `@eslint/eslintrc` and `eslint`.
