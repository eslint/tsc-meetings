## Topics

### [RFCs](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pulls)

* @nzakas requests review of [feat: ESLint Language Plugins](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/99) as a priority. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.
* [feat!: flexible config + default reporting of unused disable directives](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/100) and [feat!: check for parsing errors in suggestion fixes](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/101) are also ready for review.

### [feat: disallow destructured variable names](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/16006)

* This change adds an option to `no-underscore-dangle` to check destructured variable names.
* @btmills and @mdjermanovic reviewed it in July, but the team does not have consensus on accepting the change.
* @nzakas is neutral on this chnage because it is a stylistic preference but will go along with the team.
* @mdjermanovic and @btmills are in favor of the change because it's adding an option to fix a bug.
* Since it's been open for six months, @nzakas would like to merge without requesting further changes. @btmills and @mdjermanovic are okay making follow-up changes separately.

**Resolution:** We will accept the change, and @mdjermanovic and @btmills will figure out merging.

### [Scheduled release for December 16th, 2022](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16619)

* @mdjermanovic can do the release.
* `@eslint/eslintrc` has an updated `globals` dependency.

**Resolution:** @mdjermanovic will release `@eslint/eslintrc` and `eslint`.

### Holiday time offline

* @nzakas anticipates being offline next week.
* @mdjermanovic will be mostly online.
* @btmills hasn't decided yet but will keep the team updated.
