## Topics

### New website launch

> @nzakas:
>
> I’d like to launch the new website next week. So eslint.org becomes archive.eslint.org and then new.eslint.org becomes eslint.org. I’d plan on doing that after any patch release to give us two weeks to work out any issues.

* @mdjermanovic is aware of a few things that are still missing, like the formatters page.
* @btmills suggests adding them to the [Go-live Finishing Touches issue](https://github.com/eslint/new.eslint.org/issues/117).

**Resolution**: @mdjermanovic will record additional items on the issue.

### [Sponsorship redistribution](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/353#issuecomment-1154599196)

> @nzakas:
>
> Agenda item: Given that [Eleventy is sponsored full-time by Netlify](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-oss/), it seems that we should cancel our sponsorship and redistribute those funds to other projects that aren't as well-funded. Candidates include:
>
> * Mocha
> * Chai
> * Sinon
> * Rollup

* @btmills is :+1: to reallocating our Eleventy contribution to other projects. :+1: from @mdjermanovic.
* Open Collective's estimated annual budgets are Mocha ~$32K, Rollup ~$9K, Sinon ~$7K, Chai ~$2K.
* We previously contributed $150/mo to Eleventy.
* @mdjermanovic proposes Mocha and/or Rollup because those two are the most crucial to ESLint development.
* @mdjermanovic suggests Rollup because it's less funded than Mocha. :+1: from @btmills.

**Resolution**: We will reallocate $150/mo from Eleventy to Rollup.

### [Scheduled release for June 17th, 2022](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15968)

* @mdjermanovic will do the release.
* It'll only be `eslint`.

**Resolution**: @mdjermanovic will release `eslint`.
