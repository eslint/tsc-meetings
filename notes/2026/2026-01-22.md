### Follow-up from Previous Meeting

**Action Items Completed:**

- @nzakas sent out an email letting the team know of the payment policy. The website page explaining the policy is still pending.
- @mdjermanovic submitted [PR #20448](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20448) to document the require(esm) policy.

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** Spent most of his time writing up the year-in-review post, then investigating the Netlify charges, reviewing PRs, and looking at Codemod.
* **@mdjermanovic:** Was verifying data for the year-in-review, fixed a bug in `espree`, tested whether `eslint/js` packages head versions work with `eslint` and released `espree` and `eslint-scope` with built-in types, and fixed a bug in the core `no-shadow` rule.
* **@fasttime:** Worked on improving the location estimation for failing test cases in RuleTester and reviewed issues and PRs. Also followed up with a PR in `typescript-eslint` for ESLint v10 compatibility.

### Availability Next Two Weeks

* **@nzakas:** Still at 0.5-1 hours per weekday.
* **@mdjermanovic:** Expects to be able to work 1-1.5h each day.
* **@fasttime:** Should be available 7-9 hours per week the next two weeks.

### RFC Duty Update

* This week: @mdjermanovic
* January 26: @fasttime
* February 2: @nzakas

### Netlify Billing Resolution

**TSC Summary:** ESLint unexpectedly received an invoice for $100 for going over the limits of the open source plan. After @nzakas reached out via Twitter to Netlify's CEO, the support team removed the $100 charge and switched ESLint to an unlimited open source plan.

**Resolution:** No changes to the current setup are needed. The team will continue using Netlify without concerns about future charges.

### [Issue #671: Change Request: Introduce Prettier](https://github.com/eslint/js/issues/671)

**TSC Summary:** [ESLint v11 is planning to drop support for formatting rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20097), so this PR seeks feedback on introducing Prettier as the dedicated formatter for the JS (`eslint/js`) repository. There is currently no definitive team consensus on this change.

**TSC Questions:**
1. Would it be acceptable to introduce Prettier into the JS (`eslint/js`) repository?
2. According to the comment([Change Request: Introduce Prettier #671 (comment)](https://github.com/eslint/js/issues/671#issuecomment-3341921152)), when would be the best time to open a PR? Currently, only [feat: add types to ESLint Scope #709](https://github.com/eslint/js/pull/709) remains as part of the ESLint v10 changes.
3. The tsc-meetings repository has introduced Prettier in [chore: introduce prettier tsc-meetings#641](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/pull/641). Is there a plan to introduce Prettier to other repositories such as [create-config](https://github.com/eslint/create-config) or [eslint-github-bot](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-github-bot)?

**Discussion Points:**
- The alternative would be to have no formatting, as the rules currently used are deprecated and will be removed in the future
- The types PR has already been merged, so there are no pending changes blocking this
- Other repositories don't get a lot of changes, so switching to Prettier can be done whenever someone feels like it

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed:
- Yes, Prettier can be used in the `eslint/js` repo
- Now is a good time to start
- While no official plan exists for other repos, it's okay to switch them to use Prettier

### [Issue #331: Change Request: Support Math](https://github.com/eslint/markdown/issues/331)

**TSC Summary:** This issue proposes adding a `math` option to `languageOptions` to support math blocks using `$...$` or `$$...$$` syntax. The team has not yet reached a definitive consensus on this change.

**TSC Question:** Should this proposal be accepted?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to accept the proposal with no objections.

### [Issue #17881: Change Request: Provide a way for rules to apply suggestions to other files](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17881)

**TSC Summary:** This issue suggests expanding suggestions to be able to apply changes to other files. It provides several use cases that cannot be handled by existing systems in ESLint or Git.

**TSC Question:** Would ESLint be interested in an RFC proposing how to solve this?

**Discussion Points:**
- This is similar to [RFC #93](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/93)
- vscode-eslint reported that it can't do a callback
- Some extensions are doing cross-file updates based on mechanisms other than callbacks
- Just because something has been hacked into an ESLint rule doesn't mean it's generalizable or desirable to bake into ESLint
- The amount of work required to investigate this is out of proportion with the value it would provide
- ESLint rules shouldn't generally be updating unrelated files, even if technically possible
- A callback or event when a fix is applied by the ESLint CLI could be discussed separately

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed not to pursue applying suggestions to other files (two thumbs down and one neutral = overall thumbs down).

### [Issue #16578: Update section headings to use non-gerund forms](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16578)

**TSC Summary:** When we did our documentation update, we filed this issue to update headings.

**TSC Question:** Do we want to move forward with this or close it?

**Discussion Points:**
- Consistency is important
- AI can complete this work
- The team should remember the convention when adding new headings

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to finish this work. @nzakas will set up AI to complete it.

### V10 Development Planning

The TSC reviewed the [v10.0.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/6).

**Changes Since Last Release:**
- `eslint-scope` types have been merged
- `espree` types have been merged

- Plan to do v10.0.0 final release in two weeks

**Action Items:**
- @mdjermanovic will:
  - Open an issue with a list of todos for the final v10.0.0 release
  - Let the team know what kind of help is needed with those tasks

### Scheduled release for January 23rd, 2026

**Packages to Release:**
- `eslint` (regular release, not RC since @eslint/js is already an RC)

**Note:** `@eslint/js` was already released as an RC, so no need for another one.

**Action Items:**

- @mdjermanovic will:
  - Do the release on January 23rd
  - Release only `eslint`
  - Update the upcoming release on the eslint.org home page to the final major version
