## Attending

- Nicholas C. Zakas (@nzakas) - TSC
- Milos Djermanovic (@mdjermanovic) - TSC
- Francesco Trotta (@fasttime) - TSC

@nzakas moderated, and @sam3k took notes.

## Topics

### Follow-up from December 11 Meeting

**TSC Summary:** @fasttime confirmed that Netlify edge functions have been disabled (though the issue documenting this was created but not completed).

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** Has been focused on putting together the "2025 year in review" blog post, looking over the budget, contacting potential and possible sponsors, and working on getting `@eslint/css` to play better with `tailwind-csstree`.
* **@mdjermanovic:** Wasn't feeling well and is still not at full capacity. Was mostly reviewing PRs and triaging issues.
* **@fasttime:** Worked mostly on adding built-in types to ESLint Scope, worked on reviews, and reached out to typescript-eslint with an issue about ESLint v10 compatibility (the `LegacyESLint` issue). Has a fix ready now.

### Availability Next Two Weeks

* **@nzakas:** Still mostly 0.5-1 hour per weekday, though trying to carve out a couple straight hours on each Friday to make some coding progress.
* **@mdjermanovic:** Expects to be able to work 1-1.5 hours per day.
* **@fasttime:** Expects to be available 7-9 hours per week.

### RFC Duty Update

The TSC restarted the RFC duty schedule after the holidays:

* January 12: @nzakas
* January 19: @mdjermanovic
* January 26: @fasttime

### Budget and Spending Reductions

**TSC Summary:** ESLint lost another sponsor, bringing monthly recurring sponsorship down to $8,916/month. Recent spending has been significantly higher than income:
- September 2025: $17,354.40
- October 2025: $26,036.13
- November 2025: $18,764.56

The goal is to make the reserve last two years.

**Proposals to Reduce Costs:**
1. Set 40 as the maximum number of hours any contributor can invoice for (saves roughly $6,500/month based on prior three months)
2. Set 5 as the maximum number of hours any contributor can invoice for eslint-community work (proportional to donations received)
3. Reduce sponsorships of other projects from $150/month to $100/month (saves $375/month) - currently spending 13% of monthly income here

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to implement all three cost-cutting measures. The team prefers to make all cuts at once rather than a slow trickle periodically.

**Action Items:**
- @nzakas will:
  - Inform the team of the spending cuts
  - Set up a page on the website explaining the financial situation and policies for future reference

### [PR #20411: update find-up to v8](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20411)

**TSC Summary:** This issue proposes migrating from find-up v5 to the latest version, find-up v8, which is ESM-only now. The team hasn't reached a definitive consensus on this change.

**TSC Question:** Due to the updated Node.js version support range in ESLint v10, we can now use require(ESM) by default. The question is: what scope does this new feature apply to — only our internal packages, or can external packages use it as well?

**Discussion Points:**
- Using `require(ESM)` is only safe with dependencies the team has control over (including transitive dependencies)
- External dependencies could add top-level await in a non-breaking change, which would break ESLint
- While unlikely, this scenario is still possible and should be avoided

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed not to use external dependencies where `require(esm)` is necessary to avoid the unlikely but possible scenario where a package silently adds a top-level await that breaks ESLint in the wild. This policy should be documented in the README.

**Action Items:**
- @mdjermanovic will document the `require(ESM)` policy in the README

### [Issue #20355: Update issue templates to add checkboxes for LLM usage](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20355)

**TSC Summary:** This issue proposes adding checkboxes to issue and PR templates to better indicate if and how a contribution was AI generated. There is currently no definitive consensus from the team about this change.

**TSC Question:** Should this proposal be accepted?

**Discussion Points:**
- The wording should not sound like it's encouraged to use AI for issues
- Details can be discussed in the PR

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to accept this proposal and discuss further details on the issue/PR.

### [Issue #20294: New Rule: no-deprecated-rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20294)

**TSC Summary:** his issue proposes adding a new rule that warns when deprecated rules scheduled for removal are used. The author suggests warning when the following configuration appears in a configuration file:

```js
rules: {
    semi: ['error', 'always', { 'omitLastInOneLineBlock': true }], // Warning here
}
```

**TSC Question:** Should this proposal be accepted?

**Discussion Points:**
- This information is already available to formatters and API consumers
- A custom formatter could output the requested information
- The only thing a formatter couldn't do is alter the exit code, but it's unlikely users would want linting to fail due to deprecated rules
- The author was actually looking for a way to know when deprecated features (not just rules) are used
- If implemented, this would be a CLI-only feature since the API already provides this information

**Resolution:** The TSC unanimously agreed not to add a core rule for this. The team can continue the conversation about whether some other feature should be added to ESLint to make it easier to know when deprecated features are in use. Creating a custom formatter is a good workaround.

### [Issue #20212: change eslint packages to esm-only](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20212)

**TSC Summary:** A proposal to simplify maintenance by transitioning specific ESLint packages from dual ESM/CJS formats to ESM-only.

**TSC Question:** Does the TSC approve this change in principle? Since the required Node version already supports require(ESM), is it necessary to consider it a breaking change?

**Discussion Points:**
- It's safe to switch language plugins to ESM-only
- For dependencies of ESLint, only those that don't have dependencies the team doesn't control should be switched (while ESLint itself is still CJS)
- @eslint/markdown is already ESM-only
- For @eslint/js it would be a breaking change, could be done in v11 if switched to a full language plugin
- @eslint/json already has an accepted issue for this migration
- For @eslint/rewrite packages, some are already ESM-only
- It's very unlikely that parser packages will add top-level await

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to:
- Move forward with making @eslint/json and @eslint/css ESM-only
- Make any new packages ESM-only as well
- Defer decisions on other packages for now

### [PR #136: implement autofix for sort-keys in @eslint/json](https://github.com/eslint/json/pull/136)

**TSC Summary:** The blocker for this PR is deciding how to handle comments in JSONC/JSON5 files when auto-fixing sorting. There is currently no definitive team consensus on this change.

**TSC Question:** Which option should we choose from the following, and what common design convention was used when implementing auto-fix in JavaScript rules such as `sort-vars` or `sort-imports`?

**Options:** 
1. Keep current behavior - Accept that comments become misleading after sorting
2. Don't autofix when comments are present - Safe but limits usefulness
3. Swap members with their attached comments - Preserves documentation but complex to implement

**Discussion Points:**
- There are no similar fixable rules in core that sort code
- Most rules that might break comments just don't autofix when there are comments in the range
- `sort-vars` does autofix when comments are present and just doesn't move the comments
- `sort-keys` in core does not autofix
- Option 1 (leaving comments in misleading positions) would be considered a bug by users
- It's generally difficult and error-prone to figure out where comments belong to
- Option 3 feasibility is uncertain

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to option 2 - don't autofix when comments are present. This is the safest approach and easiest to implement.

### V10 Development Planning

The TSC reviewed the [v10.0.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/6).

#### RC Release Readiness

**TSC Summary:** The TSC reviewed whether all items were ready for the first release candidate (RC). All planned items appear to be merged, except for the eslint-scope types change.

#### [update `eslint-scope` types](https://github.com/eslint/js/issues/708)

**TSC Summary:** The PR for updating eslint-scope types needs a second review and could potentially break compatibility with third-party plugins.

**Discussion Points:**
- The change could break compatibility with third-party plugins, particularly TypeScript-ESLint which has a custom scope implementation
- Plugins that depend on `@types/eslint-scope` like html-eslint could be affected because built-in types override @types types by default
- It's unclear if html-eslint has a direct dependency on `@types/eslint-scope`, but it uses its types because it's a TypeScript repo

**TSC Question:** Should this be considered a blocker for the RC release?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed that the eslint-scope types change is not a blocker for the RC. Type changes are not regarded the same as functional changes. The team can always do a second RC with these changes if needed.

### Scheduled release for January 9th, 2026

The TSC planned the v10.0.0-rc.0 release.

**Packages to Release:**
- `eslint` v10.0.0-rc.0
- `@eslint/js` v10.0.0-rc.0
- `@eslint/core` (bug fixes)
- `@eslint/plugin-kit` (updates)
- `eslint/rewrite` packages

**Release Details:**
- For both `eslint` and `@eslint/js`, `RELEASE_TYPE` should be set to `rc`
- Both packages should be released from the `main` branch
- espree types will be released later along with eslint-scope when ready (not tomorrow)

**Action Items:**

- @fasttime will:
  - Do the release at 4pm CET on January 9th
  - Release eslint/rewrite packages before the ESLint release
  - Release `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, `@eslint/core`, and `@eslint/plugin-kit` as planned

- @mdjermanovic will:
  - Be available starting at 4pm CET (won't be available after 6pm CET) to assist if needed

**Note:** Contributor pool for December will be handled offline.
