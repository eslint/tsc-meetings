## Topics

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** has been working on the `extends` RFC, the CSS plugin, and fixing the GitHub bot.
* **@mdjermanovic:** fixed a bug with suggestions in `@eslint/markdown` and updated docs site to use flat config format in rule examples.
* **@fasttime:** opened the RFC for multithread linting, unflagged TS config file support, worked to fix some issues with types in the rewrite repo, and I also opened a PR to partly automate the process of generating TSDoc comments in rule types https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19276

### RFC Duty
* Next week: @nzakas
* Jan 20: @mdjermanovic
* Jan 27: @fasttime

### GitHub bot was down earlier this week

We're still running on Node.js 16 and Octokit made some breaking changes in a minor release so the app just crashed. 

**Action Items:** 

* @nzakas is in the process of updating the bot to run on Node.js 22 and should have it ready by next week. 
* @nzakas is going to remove some of the old plugins that are in there that we don't have enabled to reduce the amount of work.

### [Browser tests](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19234)

We're at the point now where the browser tests always fail and are useless. We need to prioritize moving to a different tool.

**Action Items:** 

* @fasttime will look into Cypress as a replacement
