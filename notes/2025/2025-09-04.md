### V10 Development Timeline

**TSC Summary:** Discussion about when to create the v9.x branch and prioritize v10 development.

**TSC Question:** Should we decide on a timeline for branching v9.x (for critical bug fixes only) and prioritizing v10 work?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to prioritize v10 issues going forward. They will work on planned v10 features and check the status at the next meeting to determine when to branch v9.x. Some v10 features depend on other v10 features, so PRs will need to be created in order.

### [Change Request: Update Node.js version support](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19969)

**TSC Summary:** This issue needs to determine Node.js version support for ESLint v10.0.0.

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed this needs to be determined sooner rather than later and should be prioritized first for v10 development.
