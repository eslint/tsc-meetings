## Topics

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** Has been mostly reviewing PRs, investigated the Discord transcript issue, and tried reaching out to some lapsed sponsors to see if he could get them back.
* **@fasttime:** Has been working on reviews, updated the eslint-scope types PR, and worked on a PR to update the Linter types for `verify` and `verifyAndFix`.

### Availability Next Two Weeks

* **@nzakas:** Will be away December 15-29, so will be off for the next two weeks.
* **@fasttime:** Should be available probably 12h next week. Will be less available until new year and unavailable on December 24, 25, and 26. Still available approximately 1 hour every day except Dec. 24-26.

### Meeting and Release Schedule Through Year End

**TSC Summary:** Given the holiday schedules, the next TSC meeting would fall on December 25.

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to:
- Cancel the next TSC meeting and resume on **January 8, 2026**
- Do one release tomorrow (December 12) and then hold off until **January 9, 2026**
- Reset RFC duty schedule when meetings resume in January
- @fasttime will be available for RFC duty as usual next week

### V10 Development Planning

The TSC reviewed the [v10.0.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/6).

#### Beta Release Readiness

**TSC Summary:** All items announced in the [v10.0.0 blog post](https://eslint.org/blog/2025/10/whats-coming-in-eslint-10.0.0/#significant-changes-in-v10.0.0-beta) for beta are complete.

**Resolution:** Tomorrow's release will be **v10.0.0-beta.0**.

#### [RuleTester test case failure reporting](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19936)

**TSC Summary:** This issue has a PR open but that will not include all changes proposed in the issue. @mdjermanovic has been working on it the most.

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to postpone discussion of this issue to the next TSC meeting (January 8) when @mdjermanovic can participate.

#### [update `eslint-scope` types](https://github.com/eslint/js/issues/708)

**TSC Summary:** The PR is ready but still pending review(s).

**Resolution:** This is not blocking anything and is fine to hold off and include in the release after beta.0. No new breaking changes will be in tomorrow's release.

### Netlify Edge Functions

**TSC Summary:** The team previously enabled Netlify edge functions during a traffic surge. The file is now much smaller, so the team should be okay bandwidth-wise if another surge happens.

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to disable Netlify edge functions at this point.

**Action Items:**
- @fasttime will open an issue to disable Netlify edge functions (as @nzakas won't have time before leaving)

### Scheduled release for December 12th, 2025

**Packages to Release:**
- `eslint` v10.0.0-beta.0
- Maintenance release from v9.x-dev branch

**Action Items:**

- @fasttime will:
  - Do the release around today's meeting time
  - Release v10.0.0-beta.0
  - Do the maintenance release after the regular release
  - Generate a new token for Jenkins and copy it to Jenkins credentials

- @nzakas will:
  - Be online around meeting time in case anything unexpected happens
