### [File ignored because outside of base path](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19118)

**TSC Summary:** Users reported that ESLint's flat config does not match files outside the current working directory, causing issues in monorepo and build tool setups. The discussion led to a proposal for a --base-path CLI option, allowing users to explicitly set the root directory for file matching. This approach was seen as a flexible, non-breaking solution that avoids confusing changes to glob pattern semantics.

**TSC Question:** Shall we move forward with this solution?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to move forward with the proposed --base-path option. The issue will be marked as accepted and "Waiting for RFC".

### Parallel Linting PR

* @fasttime reported the PR should be ready next week
* @nzakas requested prioritizing this work to take advantage of @mdjermanovic's last week for review
* @fasttime planning to implement the last todo on the weekend, expecting it to be ready Monday or Tuesday
