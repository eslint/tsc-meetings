# 08/07/2025 ESLint TSC Meeting Transcript

**nzakas:** Howdy!

**fasttime:** Hi!

**nzakas:** It'll just be us today as @mdjermanovic is away

**fasttime:** Yes

**nzakas:** Just going through last meeting's notes

**nzakas:** Looks like we don't have any followups from last week.

**nzakas:** Last meeting, that is.
 * 👍 @fasttime

**nzakas:** Let's start with statuses. I've mostly been reviewing PRs for the Markdown and CSS plugins, which have had a lot of activity. I updated the MCP server prompt so it allows autofixing if requested, and continued work on the CSS variables RFC.

**fasttime:** I've been mostly busy reviewing PRs and a few issues. Other than that, I've updated the multithread linting PR and worked on some maintenance tasks.

**nzakas:** Let's talk availability for the next couple of weeks. I'm going to have a bit less time, around one hour per weekday, until the end of August.

**fasttime:** I should be able to work about 1 hour during weekdays and maybe 2 on the weekends, so like 9 hours per week. I expect to have more time starting August 18.

**nzakas:** RFC Duty:
This week - @nzakas 
August 11 - @fasttime 
August 18 - @nzakas
 * 👍 @fasttime

**nzakas:** It doesn't look like we have anything flagged for today. Any issues or PRs you'd like to discuss?

**fasttime:** Nothing in particular.

**nzakas:** Want to share a status update on parallel linting?

**fasttime:** There's only one open question: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19794#discussion_r2235619344

**fasttime:** Other than that no feedback to address. Shall we write a blog post?

**nzakas:** Write a blog about...?

**fasttime:** About the multithread linting, I mean

**nzakas:** When it's released, yes.

**fasttime:** Okay 🙂  That's all I think.

**nzakas:** For including `URL`, it looks like it's available in the TypeScript DOM library, so we could do:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM"]
  }
}
```

?

**nzakas:** Although we don't have a `tsconfig.json` at the top-level. 🤔

**fasttime:** I think the problem is more consumers that don't use the DOM library or `@types/node` in their dependencies.

**fasttime:** For that we should add a production dependency on `@types/node` or ask TS consumers to use `@types/node` or a built-in library  that provides a definition for `URL`.

**nzakas:** That feels pretty clunky

**fasttime:** Yes

**nzakas:** Because this is the last blocking decision, then let's go with your idea of a custom type for now. As long as we have a runtime check for instanceof URL, then I think that gets us most of what we want.

**fasttime:** Sounds good. We can probably change this later with a simple fix.

**nzakas:** Yeah, that's my thinking too.

**fasttime:** Okay, I'll do the change.
 * 👍 @nzakas

**nzakas:** Oh, and OptionModule vs. OptionsModule?

**nzakas:** Ah looks like you already made that change

**nzakas:** Sorry, haven't caught up yet today.

**fasttime:** Yeah 🙂 I did that already.
 * 👍 @nzakas

**nzakas:** Okay, anything else before we talk contributor pool?

**fasttime:** Nothing from my side.

**nzakas:** Here's the report from July:
https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/blob/main/notes/2025/2025-07-01-contributor-pool.md

**nzakas:** Another massive month for contributions.
 * 😮 @fasttime

**nzakas:** I'm going to ask ChatGPT to review and give some recommendations. 🙂

**fasttime:** Good idea, let's give it a try.

**nzakas:** Here's what I got:

**nzakas:** I think I'd probably bump xbinaryx up to $800

**nzakas:** Removing rollup and extra types from `@eslint/markdown` was a larger job

**fasttime:** I didn't review their PRs but I also think that some of them seem larger

**nzakas:** Ah some of these are for new rules, which we typically pay higher for, let me adjust that algorithm and see what we come up with.

**nzakas:** This looks better

**nzakas:** Let's talk the release tomorrow.

**fasttime:** I can do the release tomorrow.

**nzakas:** Thanks!

**fasttime:** There are some PRs pending a second review, I'm not sure if there's anything important for tomorrows release.

**nzakas:** We should probably merge this and bump `@eslint/core`: https://github.com/eslint/rewrite/pull/252

**fasttime:** Okay, I can do that tomorrow.
 * 👍 @nzakas

**fasttime:** Other than that it will be only `eslint` and `@eslint/js` I think.

**nzakas:** Looks like it
 * 👍 @fasttime

**nzakas:** If there's not anything else, then I think we're done. Thanks (and thanks @sam3k_ for the notes)

**fasttime:** Thanks! Bye 👋

**nzakas:** 👋
