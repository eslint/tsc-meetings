## Topics

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** Has been mostly focused on switching packages to trusted publishing. All release-please packages are now officially migrated.
* **@mdjermanovic:** Was working on removing nodejsScope option from eslint-scope, switching eslint/rewrite packages to trusted publishing, and testing and providing feedback for file-entry-cache v11 to unblock the Relative cache support RFC.
* **@fasttime:** Was mostly busy with fixing the configuration types in pnpm, and worked on some maintenance PRs.

### Availability Next Two Weeks

* **@nzakas:** Still 0.5-1 hours per weekday.
* **@mdjermanovic:** Expects to be available around 2 hours each day.
* **@fasttime:** Should be available 9-12 hours per week.

### RFC Duty Update

* This week: @fasttime
* October 20: @nzakas
* October 27: @mdjermanovic

### Inactive RFC Authors and Next Steps

**TSC Summary:** @fasttime noticed that the author of [RFC #114 (Relative cache support)](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/114) (@cs6cs6) hasn't been active on GitHub this year at all. The RFC has been open for two years and was previously blocked on file-entry-cache. The just-released file-entry-cache v11 now supports what's needed for this RFC. Additionally, [RFC #128 (Localization)](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/128) has also been inactive.

**TSC Question:** What should be done with these inactive RFCs?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed on the following approach for both RFCs:
- **RFC #114 (Relative cache support):** Give the author one week to see if they'd like to pick it up. If there's no response after a week, @mdjermanovic will open a new RFC to continue the work.
- **RFC #128 (Localization):** Post on the RFC to see if the author still wants to continue with it. If after a week there's no response, the RFC will be closed.

### V10 Development Planning

The TSC reviewed the [v10.0.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/6/views/1) and discussed several items.

#### [Rule Change: `radix` rule should have better options](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19916)

**TSC Summary:** This issue was missed in the last meeting. It proposes implementing suggestions for the `radix` rule with a new option.

**TSC Question:** Should we include this in v10?

**Resolution:** The TSC unanimously agreed to include this in v10.

#### [Future of ecmaFeatures.globalReturn](https://github.com/eslint/js/issues/525)

**TSC Summary:** A user noted that removing `ecmaFeatures.globalReturn` will make it more difficult to lint code that runs in environments that wrap the code in a function but are not CommonJS environments (e.g., userscripts). The user would need to set `sourceType: "commonjs"` to get an approximation, but their code isn't CommonJS and doesn't have CommonJS globals.

**TSC Question:** Should we proceed with removing `ecmaFeatures.globalReturn` and `nodejsScope` despite this use case?

**Analysis:**
- Setting `globalReturn: true` adds a function scope around the code and affects rules such as `no-redeclare`
- `ecmaFeatures.globalReturn` works hand-in-hand with eslint-scope's `nodejsScope`
- The only current option for users would be to set `sourceType: "commonjs"`, but this includes CommonJS globals that may not apply to their use case

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to defer this change to v11 with the intent to find a way to support the userscript use case that doesn't require `globalReturn`. @nzakas expressed that he'd prefer not to remove a use case without adding an official way to support it, and didn't see removing these options as particularly important to v10.

#### V10 Prerelease Timeline

**TSC Summary:** The team discussed the timing of the first v10 alpha release. The main blocker is [issue #19967](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19967) - flipping all `v10_*` flags to be on by default, which is needed to be ready for the first prerelease as it includes the "lookup from file" feature that was announced in the blog post.

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed that this should be complete in the next two weeks, with a tentative date of **November 14th** for the first v10 alpha release (assuming one more minor release in two weeks).

### Scheduled release for October 17th, 2025

**Action Items:**

- @mdjermanovic will:
  - Release `eslint` and `@eslint/js`
  - Release `@eslint/config-helpers` with bug fixes in `defineConfig()`
  - Release everything merged in eslint/rewrite

- @nzakas will:
  - Review PRs tomorrow morning:
    - [eslint/rewrite#288](https://github.com/eslint/rewrite/pull/288) - fix: use flat config when eslintrc config does not exist
    - [eslint/rewrite#289](https://github.com/eslint/rewrite/pull/289) - fix: improve type support for isolated dependencies in pnpm
    - [eslint/rewrite#294](https://github.com/eslint/rewrite/pull/294) - fix: fix `config-array` and `object-schema` types
    - [eslint/eslint#20048](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20048) - feat: update `complexity` rule to only highlight function header
  - Try to finish [eslint/eslint#20168](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20168) - refactor: Use types from @eslint/core

- @fasttime will:
  - Be available tomorrow to make small changes if necessary

**Note:** @mdjermanovic will plan the release for evening (CET) to give time for implementations and reviews. @nzakas noted that updating package.json versions of the rewrite packages should be sufficient - no other updates needed in eslint/eslint for those two PRs.
