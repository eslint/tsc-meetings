### eslint.org Bandwidth Issues

**TSC Summary:** ESLint received an email from Netlify reporting that 50% of the monthly bandwidth allowance had been used early in October. Investigation revealed that bandwidth usage had jumped by more than 50x starting September 25th. Netlify's Elad Rosenheim identified a spike in requests from China targeting https://eslint.org/feed.xml with suspicious user agents (specifically Chrome 58). The problem was compounded by feed.xml being over 600kb because it included every blog post ever published on eslint.org.

**Resolution:** The TSC implemented a two-part solution:
1. Reduced feed.xml file size by limiting it to only the 10 most recent blog posts ([PR #795](https://github.com/eslint/eslint.org/pull/795))
2. Added a temporary firewall rule to block all traffic from China, with plans to replace it with a targeted Netlify Edge function that only blocks China from accessing feed.xml ([PR #796](https://github.com/eslint/eslint.org/pull/796))

The team noted they currently have ~350GB bandwidth remaining until October 19, which should cover normal usage. @mdjermanovic suggested it would be helpful to have notifications for bandwidth spikes, though @nzakas noted this feature isn't currently available from Netlify. @fasttime asked about viewing request analytics without contacting Netlify, but this capability also doesn't exist.

### "Feedback Needed" Label Usage

**TSC Summary:** @nzakas raised concerns that the "Feedback Needed" label has become a parking lot for most changes, including simple, straightforward issue requests ([example: eslint/eslint#20165](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20165)). This appears unnecessary when requests are low-risk and unlikely to face concerns from other team members.

**TSC Question:** Should we reserve "Feedback Needed" for controversial, large, breaking, or risky changes, and allow TSC members to mark low-risk issues as accepted without requiring additional feedback?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to reserve "Feedback Needed" for larger decisions that genuinely need team input. TSC members can now proactively mark smaller changes they agree with as "accepted" to avoid blocking straightforward improvements while waiting for consensus.

### V10 Development Planning

The TSC reviewed the [v10.0.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/6) and agreed to finalize the scope today, deciding that after this meeting no more features will be considered for v10 (anything else must wait for v11).

#### [Change Request: Remove deprecated Node and renamed core rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20171)

**TSC Summary:** While working on another issue, it was discovered that 19 rules have deprecation metadata with `availableUntil` set to null. Of these, 17 are safe to remove (deprecated in ESLint < 8).

**TSC Question:** Should we remove these deprecated rules in v10 or defer to v11?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to move this to v11. @nzakas expressed no urgency to remove deprecated rules, and all members agreed this can wait. All deprecated rules accumulated so far will be considered for removal in v11.

#### [Change Request: Remove `nodejsScope` option of eslint-scope](https://github.com/eslint/js/issues/697)

**TSC Summary:** There are currently two different ways to enable commonjs scope analysis in eslint-scope. This issue proposes removing the `nodejsScope` option to consolidate the approach.

**TSC Question:** Should we remove the `nodejsScope` option from eslint-scope for v10?

**Resolution:** The TSC unanimously agreed to remove `nodejsScope` from eslint-scope for v10.

**Next Steps:** The TSC noted that changes to eslint-scope and espree need to be completed before considering a prerelease. They agreed to re-evaluate v10 prerelease readiness at the next TSC meeting.

### October 2025 Contributor Pool

### Scheduled release for October 3rd, 2025

**Action Items:**

- @fasttime will:
  - Release `@eslint/js` and `eslint`
- @nzakas will:
  - Work with @fasttime and @mdjermanovic to review and publish the ["What's coming in ESLint v10.0.0" blog post](https://github.com/eslint/eslint.org/pull/792) alongside the release

**Note:** @mdjermanovic left a suggestion for adding a paragraph about scope manager changes, but @nzakas noted that typescript-eslint is already aware of the change and there are no other known scope managers, so it may not need to be mentioned in the blog post.
