* **@fasttime:** Mostly busy reviewing PRs and a few issues. Other than that, updated the multithread linting PR and worked on some maintenance tasks.

### Availability Next Two Weeks

### [feat: multithread linting](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19794)

**TSC Summary:** The multithread linting PR has one remaining open question regarding TypeScript and the URL type.

**TSC Question:** How should we handle the URL type inclusion in TypeScript?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to use a custom type for now with a runtime check for `instanceof URL`. This can be changed later with a simple fix. @fasttime will implement this change. @nzakas will write a blog post once released.
