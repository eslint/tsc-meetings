## Topics

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** been working on a couple of RFCs (CSS variable tracking and rule language metadata), adding token methods to JSONSourceCode, and a bunch of build-related stuff (contributor pool report generation, automated baseline data). Opened PR for moving more types into `@eslint/core`: https://github.com/eslint/rewrite/pull/237
* **@fasttime:** been working on switching performance tests to hyperfine, updating the multithread linting RFC, and reviewing issues and PRs.

### RFC Duty update:

* This week - @Nicholas C. Zakas
* July 14 - @fasttime
* July 21 - @mdjermanovic

### [Change Request: internal `rule.meta.docs.recommended` type is leaked](https://github.com/eslint/rewrite/issues/234)

**TSC Summary:** This issue reports that the internal type for `rule.meta.docs.recommended` in ESLint is too restrictiveâ€”it is typed as boolean | undefined, but some plugins (notably typescript-eslint) use other values (like strings or objects) for config generation. This causes TypeScript type errors when using defineConfig(), even though it works at runtime.

**TSC Question:** What do we want to do here? Some options:
- Omit the recommended field from the type definition.
- Change its type to unknown (with a note that ESLint itself uses boolean).
- Use a union type to allow any value for recommended in configs.

**Resolution:** We've agreed to set the type of `meta.docs.recommended` to `unknown`.

### [feat: multithread linting](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19794)

**TSC Summary:** The multithread linting PR is in progress with two remaining points to address before review.

**TSC Question:** What is the status and timeline for completion?

**Resolution:** @fasttime has two points to decide/work on before making this ready for review:
1. Emitting warning when concurrency is used inappropriately (e.g. because there aren't many files)
2. How to handle concurrency=1

@fasttime will post an updated description of the problem on the weekend and @mdjermanovic will participate in the discussion.

### [Change Request: Autogenerated type definitions for rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18912)

**TSC Summary:** This issue has been open for 9 months without a PR. Tanuj is assigned to work on autogenerated type definitions for rules.

**TSC Question:** What is the status and approach for this issue?

**Resolution:** @nzakas will ping Tanuj again to check on the status and approach.
