* **@mdjermanovic:** Was working on v10-related eslint-scope update regarding globals, and reviewing a lot of PRs.
* **@fasttime:** Worked on disallowing eslint-env comments and other v10 related tasks, also reviewed v10 related PRs.

### Discontinuing zh-hans.docs.eslint.org Site

**TSC Summary:** The Chinese documentation site is currently on v8.50.0, which is 2 years old and more than 40 versions behind, including 1 major version. The question was whether to continue updating it given the maintenance burden.

**TSC Question:** Do we want to keep updating our zh-hans docs site?

**Analysis:** The Chinese site receives 4,000 users per month compared to 140,000 users on the English docs site. While aladdin-add mentioned willingness to help update the site to v9, there are concerns about it falling significantly behind again.

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to no longer update the zh-hans.eslint.org site. It's not cost-effective to pay for hourly translation work given the relatively low traffic. @nzakas noted that automated documentation translation remains on his long-term todo list for potential future revisiting.

### V10 Development Planning

The TSC reviewed the [v10.0.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/6) and discussed several new issues.

### [Change Request: Remove deprecated formatting rules from core](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20097)

**TSC Summary:** This issue proposes removing all deprecated formatting rules from core in v10, as they were deprecated in 8.53.0 and a replacement plugin exists.

**TSC Question:** Should we remove deprecated formatting rules in v10?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed it's too soon to remove these rules and decided to postpone this to v11. The issue was moved to the v11 board. Additionally, the TSC agreed to update the `availableUntil` meta property to "11.0.0" for all deprecated formatting rules for clarity. @mdjermanovic will handle this update.

### [Bug: `func-names` schema allows extra elements](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20134)

**TSC Summary:** The func-names rule schema incorrectly allows extra, unused elements.

**TSC Question:** Should we fix the func-names schema to not allow extra elements in v10?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to include this fix in v10. It's a small change with low impact.

### [Change Request: Remove deprecated SourceCode methods](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20113)

**TSC Summary:** Several SourceCode methods have been deprecated for multiple versions but are still present in the runtime and type definitions.

**Methods to remove:**
- `getTokenOrCommentBefore()` and `getTokenOrCommentAfter()` - deprecated in v4
- `isSpaceBetweenTokens()` - deprecated in v6.7.0  
- `getJSDocComment()` - deprecated in 2018

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to remove all four deprecated methods in v10. These methods have had sufficient deprecation notice (7+ years for some). The TSC also agreed to provide fallback implementations in @eslint/compat for users who still need them. eslint-stylistic has already replaced its usage of these methods.

### [Change Request: Update Node.js version support](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19969)

**TSC Summary:** Need to establish Node.js version support for ESLint v10.0.0, particularly considering the availability of `require(ESM)` functionality.

**Discussion:** The TSC discussed whether to use `require(ESM)` as a determining factor for version support. While it's currently at stability level 1.2 (Release Candidate), @nzakas felt it's close enough to stable to consider using. This would allow for more flexibility in distributing language plugins as ESM-only or converting eslint/rewrite packages to ESM-only.

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed that the supported Node.js versions for v10 will be `^20.19.0 || ^22.13.0 || >=24`. This range provides access to `require(ESM)` functionality while maintaining reasonable version support.

### V10 Documentation Tasks

**TSC Summary:** Two additional tasks are needed for v10 that aren't currently represented in issues:

1. **"What's coming in v10" blog post** - Typically published before the first prerelease to give users advance notice of changes
2. **Migration guide** - Following the v9 approach of merging a shell first, then having PR authors update it as they implement changes

**Resolution:** Both tasks were added to the v10 project board and left unassigned for anyone to claim.

### Scheduled release for September 19th, 2025

**Action Items:**

- @mdjermanovic will:
  - Release `eslint` and `@eslint/js`
  - Handle other pending autorelease PRs next week

**Note:** There was discussion of PR [#20048](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20048) (update `complexity` rule to only highlight function header), but it's not critical and needs additional tests.
