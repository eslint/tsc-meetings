### [Rule Change: support TypeScript syntax in no-duplicate-imports](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19834)

**TSC Summary:** The issue is requesting an enhancement to the no-duplicate-imports rule to better support TypeScript syntax. The current rule flags an error when TypeScript type imports are used alongside regular imports from the same module. Currently, the rule reports an error when a file includes both a value import and a type import from the same module.

**TSC Question:** Do we want to add the proposed option allowSeparateTypeImports that would allow separate import statements for types from the same module without triggering the "duplicate imports" rule error?

**Resolution: we've resolved to accept the proposal for the `allowSeparateTypeImports` option to allow `import type` alongside `import` from the same module.

### Automate Contributor List

**Action Items:** @nzakas will write a script to automate generating a list of contributors

### [feat: Extendable types for rules and settings configs](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19843)

`RuleEntry` will no longer make all `Options` optional in rule config entries. Should all rules options be optional or not?

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will check on this and report on [this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19843#discussion_r2142999877) thread.
