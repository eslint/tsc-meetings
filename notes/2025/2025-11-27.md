### V10 Development Planning

The TSC reviewed the [v10.0.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/6).

#### Current Status

**TSC Summary:** Not all breaking changes will be merged in time for tomorrow's release, so the next release will be v10.0.0-alpha.1 (not alpha.0). Several breaking changes have been merged since alpha.0.

**Upcoming Breaking Changes:**
- The JSX-related breaking change is almost finished and expected to be merged for the release after this one
- The `chalk` → `util.styleText` migration is work in progress and also expected for the release after this one
- `eslint-scope` types PR just needs reviews

#### [RuleTester test case failure reporting](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19936)

**TSC Summary:** The issue proposes improving RuleTester to point to the failing test case in the source code. There's already a PR ([#19976](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19976)) for a non-breaking part of the proposed change.

**Discussion Points:**
- The original PR implementation added a `node:fs` dependency to RuleTester, which was the reason this was added to v10
- The current PR no longer includes `node:fs` dependency, but it's unclear whether adding it conditionally would still be a breaking change
- Per [previous discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19976#issuecomment-3144785189), the team decided to be safe and still consider conditional node:fs dependency as a breaking change
- The challenge is whether RuleTester can analyze test source code to find the test case while maintaining compatibility with current rule tests
- This is the only problematic change left for v10

**TSC Question:** Should we focus on resolving this issue/PR in the next week?

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to focus on issue #19936 and PR #19976 from next week as an action item. The goal is to maintain compatibility with current rule tests if feasible, though there may need to be some restrictions. If it's not ready in time, the team will discuss it again in the next meeting.

### Contributor Pool for October

The TSC reviewed the contributor pool for October based on the [November 1st contributor pool report](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/blob/main/notes/2025/2025-11-01-contributor-pool.md).

**Budget:** $1071.70 (calculated from the report)

**Contributors:** 8 contributors with 20 PRs total

**Final Distribution:**
- xbinaryx: $350 (big fix in eslint.org repo and big refactor in code explorer)
- jaymarvelz: $250
- Sethamus: $200 (increased from initial $150 proposal due to amount of work)
- thecalamiity: $150
- TKDev7: $150

**Total:** $1100

**Note:** The final total is slightly over the calculated budget ($1100 vs $1071.70).

### Scheduled release for November 28th, 2025

The TSC planned the v10.0.0-alpha.1 release.

**Packages to Release:**
- `eslint` v10.0.0-alpha.1
- `@eslint/js` (has changes since alpha.0)
- `@eslint/eslintrc` (addresses a problem that @eslint/js would introduce for users who still use eslintrc configs)

**Action Items:**

- @mdjermanovic will:
  - Do the release on November 28th
  - Release `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, and `@eslint/eslintrc`

- @fasttime will:
  - Do the next release (likely the last release of the year)

- TSC will:
  - Focus on issue #19936 and PR #19976 starting next week
