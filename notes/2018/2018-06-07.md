## Topics

### [v5.0 release candidate](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/87#issuecomment-390709484)

* Agenda item: I think we should decide on a schedule for the stable v5.0 release. We've already received 3 requests to backport changes that have landed on master ([1](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10244), [2](https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint?at=5af62e259ad18967b9dbd10b), [3](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/10182#issuecomment-390704945)), so the delay in putting these changes from master into a release is having an impact on our users.
* :+1: from @btmills, @platinumazure, @not-an-aardvark, @mysticatea, @kaicataldo

**Resolution**: The next release will be a release candidate, with the final release to follow assuming no major bugs.

### [Docs: Add new experimental syntax policy to README (fixes #9804)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/10408)

**TSC Summary:** This pull requests attempts to clarify our README with the experimental feature policy suggested by Nicholas here: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9804#issuecomment-360810237
**TSC Question:** Does this PR capture the intent of the new policy accurately and clearly? Should we make this change? (Less importantly, are there other documentation areas that should be similarly changed?)
* Would like to expand the policy to describe how we make other decisions "on a case-by-case basis".
* We should specify that stage 3 "don't crash" support in core rules is limited to ESTree's experimental AST representations.
* :+1: from @mysticatea, @not-an-aardvark, @kaicataldo, @btmills, @platinumazure

**Resolution**: Accept the policy, including stating that we only accept PRs to modify core rules to prevent them from crashing on stage 3 syntax if the modification follows ESTree's experimental AST node format.

### [Scheduled release for June 8th, 2018](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10411)

* As decided above, this will be a release candidate.
* Espree, currently in alpha, had one feature update, so it should advance to release candidate as well.

**Resolution**: @kaicataldo and @platinumazure will do the release.
