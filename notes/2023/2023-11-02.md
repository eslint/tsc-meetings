## Topics

### [Bug: FlatArrayConfig options cannot be overriden](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17669)

**TSC Summary:** This issue points out that we are handling basePath in a confusing way. The underlying implementation uses `path.relative()`, which treats `""` as equal to `process.cwd()`, so even though ConfigArray is supposed to have no knowledge of the filesystem, it implicitly does through this mechanism. The intent was for basePath: `""` to basically match everything, but that isn't the case.

**Resolution:**

1. Agreed to pass cwd as the default value for basePath in Linter. That will solve the immediate problem and gives us time to think through whether or not we need a change in ConfigArray.

2. Will continue discussing whether to interpret `""` as `process.cwd()`
