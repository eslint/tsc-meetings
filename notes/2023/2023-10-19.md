## Topics

### [fix: Behavior of CLI when no arguments are passed](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/17644)

**TSC Summary:** This PR changes the default behavior of the ESLint CLI when no file arguments are passed in. In eslintrc mode, the CLI now reports an error; in flat config mode, the CLI now assumes . as the file argument. This may cause a problem for people trying to use the CLI as part of a [precommit check](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14308#issuecomment-1571995912). Before this change, the CLI would exit with a zero exit code when no file arguments were present, after this change, it will either error or lint every file, neither of which seems desirable.

**TSC Questions:**

1. This now looks like a breaking change, should we add it to v9? (This was originally intended to be completed with the [flat config work](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14308#issuecomment-944829863), so it should have been included?)

2. Do we want to provide a way to mimic the current behavior? Jest has a `--passwithnotests` CLI flag that we could mimic for this purpose.

**Resolution:**

1. Agreed to make this a breaking change and go into v9

2. Agreed to add new flag on both; eslintrc and flat config, and will workshop the name on the issue

### v9 Branching Strategy

**TSC Summary:** Regarding the branching strategy: It appears that there is no easy way to maintain a separate branch for v9, so we've decided not to pursue that.

Which just leaves the question of how we want to proceed. We generally have three options:

1. What we did for v7 and earlier: Decide when we want to start merging v9 features and stop all v8 features. That means we could have several months without any releases while we work through all the v9 issues.

2. What we did for v8: Keep working on v8 while also working on v9 features. We just don't merge any v9 features until we've got all the PRs lined up.

3. New: Combine 2 and 1 by defining some minimal set of v9 features we want done in order to start merging. At that point, we stop all v8 releases.

**Resolution:** we are going with option 3 and add two new fields to the v9 board; `Planned - Alpha`  and `Planned - Beta`. Here is the breakdown:

Once we've got those 13 issues with PRs ready, we can switch to v9 mode

**Action Item:** @nzakas will write a blog post about the plan

### [docs: Add note about invalid CLI flags when using flat config](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/17664)

**TSC Summary:** The latest object-schema release 2.0 seems to be breaking using error templates. If we don't sort that out until tomorrow's release, what do you think about pinning config-array to the previous v0.11.11

**Action Item:** @nzakas will take a look

### Scheduled release for October 20th, 2023

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will release the following:
