## Topics

### [Shutting down HackerOne](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/402#issuecomment-1379528636)

> @nzakas: Now that people can report security vulnerabilities through GitHub, can we shut down our Hacker One account?

* @btmills, @mdjermanovic, and @nzakas are all in favor.

**Resolution:** @btmills is an admin and will shut down the account.

### [Shutting down Google Groups](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/402#issuecomment-1379528636)

> @nzakas: Should we retire the mailing list? It seems like we have much better options now (Discussions, Discord, etc.).

* @nzakas, @mdjermanovic, and @btmills are all in favor.

**Resolution:** @nzakas will remove the mailing list from the website and shut down the group.

### [fix: use function identifier on `max-lines-per-function`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/16271)

* @nzakas has no opinion.
* @mdjermanovic sees both the proposed change and the current behavior being useful prefer leaving it as-is.
* @btmills doesn't feel the proposed change is a clear improvement.

**Resolution:** We'll keep the current behavior.

### [[FR] option to ignore code blocks by meta string](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-plugin-markdown/issues/208)

* @btmills previously wrote a [list of options](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-plugin-markdown/issues/208#issuecomment-1195147175) on the thread. The best options are either forking the processor or adding processor options.
* @mdjermanovic remembers we previously accepted [RFC 39: Access to options in processors](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/blob/main/designs/2019-processor-shared-settings/README.md).
* @nzakas thinks processor options follow logically from parser and language options.
* There was an [unfinished PR](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12068) implementing the RFC, so @btmills offers to respond offering the processor options route if someone's willing to do the work to update the design for flat config and implement it. :+1: from @mdjermanovic and @nzakas.
* @nzakas asks @btmills to create a tracking issue.
* @btmills clarifies that we will not require a new RFC for flat config processor options.
@nzakas confirms and says we can move straight to Ready to Implement in the Triage board.

**Resolution:** @btmills will respond on the processor issue thread and create a tracking issue for processor options.

### [Bug: just focus on rule being examined](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16554)

* @nzakas asks whether we should consider it a bug that `/* eslint-disable some-nonexistent-rule */` is throwing an error.
* We discussed this previously in [Unknown rule in disable directive throwing unnecessary errors](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14851).
* @nzakas like's [@btmills's proposal](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14851#issuecomment-947517747) with [@mdjermanovic's caveat](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14851#issuecomment-947792219) from the previous issue.
* @mdjermanovic thinks this isn't a bug and would expect ESLint to report invalid directives.
* @nzakas doesn't think that `/* eslint foo: 0 */` should be flagged.
* @mdjermanovic says not reporting nonexistent rules when users typo directives would be confusing. @nzakas concurs.
* Between treating `/* eslint foo: 0 */` as an unknown rule or unused disable directive so that it's detectable, @btmills prefers a directive.
* @nzakas refocuses on whether we want the current behavior for `/* eslint-disable-* */`. @mdjermanovic is clearly in favor, and @nzakas is leaning yes.
* @mdjermanovic thinks the current behavior is correct, but we could better support inline config and linting with different configs with something like [Support directive comment groups](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13472).
* @btmills believes the current behavior is better than not reporting at all, but treating it as an unused directive would be better.
* @btmills, @mdjermanovic, and @btmills all agree the current behavior is not a bug. @nzakas suggests closing this issue, and either or both of @btmills and @mdjermanovic can open new issues proposing improvements. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.

**Resolution:** Close this issue as not a bug.

### [Scheduled release for January 13th, 2023](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16737)

* @btmills volunteers.
* There are two docs changes that are ready:
	* [docs: IA Update page URL move](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/16665) should be merged immediately before the release.
	* [docs: add redirects for docs IA update](https://github.com/eslint/eslint.org/pull/388) should be merged immediately after.

**Resolution:** @btmills will do the release.
