## Topics

### Jenkins Update

**TSC Summary:** we we're running into issues with `re2` failing to compile during the release, which is something we also dealt with on GitHub, which caused us to remove `metascraper` to do the release.

In trying to update our Node.js version on the Jenkins server, it turned out we were using Debian 9 and all of the apt-get repositories for that version were basically noops due to how old it was, so I couldn't actually update Node.js

**Resolution:** @nzakas requested a new droplet with Debian 12 and spent the last couple of days setting up a new version of Jenkins and porting over our remaining four release jobs then tested on (`eslint-release`) and it worked.

### [v9.0.0](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/4/views/2)

**TSC Summary:** It looks like the only functionality issue that hasn't been started yet is [Change default rule schema to `schema: []` and drop support for function-style rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14709)

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will:
* Take this issue
* design changes for `no-restricted-imports` and `no-inner-declarations`
* Look into some questions unanswered in the [`/* exported */` should not allow values](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17622) issue

### Scheduled release for November 17th, 2023

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will release the following:
* `eslint`
* `@eslint/js`
