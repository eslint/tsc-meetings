## Topics


### [feat: Add suppress ignored file warnings RFC](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/90)

**TSC Summary:** We have decided that the RFC should be changed so if the warnIgnored option of lintText() is not specified, it will default to the warnIgnored value for the FlatESLint instance.

> @mdjermanovic
>
> Although it's a breaking change for FlatESLint class users, we can release it in a 8.x minor version of ESLint

**Action Item:** @mdjermanovic will leave another comment to clarify what should be updated in the RFC (basically, it should be reverted to the previous version, then updated to work on FlatESLint instead of ESLint)

### [Implement Flat Config](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13481)

> @nzakas
>
> I started working with the typescript-eslint folks and we ran into an issue because they use Nx, and Nx directly uses the ESLint class rather than the CLI, so it can't use flat config until it is updated to also use the FlatESLint class.

**Action Items:** 
* @mdjermanovic will start on `eslint-plugin-n` next week
* James is [going to work on](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/6836) implementing flat config on `typescript-eslint`

### Scheduled release for April 21st, 2023

**Action Item:** @mdjermanovic will release `eslint` and `@eslint/js`
