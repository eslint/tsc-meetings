#### Regarding issue [#17524](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17524)

**Summary:** There were some concerns regarding breaking some integrations that expect certain formatters. We'll post the issue on Twitter and Mastodon to see if we can get some early feedback on potential issues. 

**Resolution:** We've agreed to include this issue in v9 with a note that we can use the beta period to evaluate the safety of this change and reverse course if necessary.

### v9 Release Strategy

**Summary:** Could we simplify our merging strategy by introducing a `v9-candidate` branch to which we merge PRs into? Then, once ready, we can submit a PR from `v9-candidate` to `main`.

**Resolution:** @mdjermanovic will investigate how Node.js solve this. We have an [example](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/49528) of how Node.js does it.

### Scheduled release for September 8th, 2023

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will handle the release:
* `eslint`
* `eslint/js`
