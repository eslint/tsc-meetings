## Topics

### [Allow all directives in line comments](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14575)

**TSC Summary:** This accepted proposal is to allow all inline directives in line comments in addition to block comments. When we tried to implement this, the result was fairly disruptive to the ecosystem. This issue has been open for over a year without any progress.

**TSC Question:** Should we close that as "won't fix" now that we know the result when we tried to do this last?

**Resolution:** we've agreed to close it as we can't implement the original RFC as it stands.

### [v9.0.0 Timeline](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/4/views/1)

| [Remove `SourceCode#getComments()`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14744) |2| | | |
|[Change default rule schema to `schema: []` and drop support for function-style rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14709)|2| | | |
| [Change Request: Enable `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` config option by default](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15466)|2| | | |

ESLint [deprecation policies](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/rule-deprecation) might need to be updated to reflect these changes |

| [Remove warnings when linting ignored files](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15010) | 2 | | | This needs to be done before releasing v9.0.0 |
| [[Flat Config] Drop support for string configurations `"eslint:recommended"` and `"eslint:all"`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17488) | 2 | | | |
| [Change Request: Deprecate and remove `CodePath#currentSegments`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17457) | 1 | | 1 | <blockquote> @mdjermanovic: will look at the `traverse` branch and try to understand the problem over the weekend</blockquote> <blockquote>@nzakas: mixing data and state on the same object is blocking any progress here</blockquote> <blockquote>@mdjermanovic: What's confusing me is that our code path analysis is generally stateful (the tree is updated during the traversal) so I'm not sure if removing only currentSegments would fix the problem</blockquote> <blockquote>@nzakas: That's true, but currentSegments is the only part that leaks the traversal state through into rules (at least, as best I can tell). What I want to do is have it act more like scope analysis </blockquote> <blockquote>@mdjermanovic: But I'm not sure that I fully understand the problem yet, so I'll take a look at the code. Scope analysis traverses the code by itself</blockquote> <blockquote>@nzakas: Right, and it creates a tree that we then reference from within rules via `getScope()`. There isn't a good reason that code path analysis can't do the same thing</blockquote> <blockquote>@mdjermanovic: With code path analysis, I think the goal was to avoid an extra traversal, though it makes things more complicated and less predictable for rule developers. Since you can't know what's finalized at any moment.</blockquote> <blockquote>@nzakas: Yeah, and I'm actually not adding an extra traversal with the traverse branch. `SourceCode#traverse()` is doing a traversal with code path analysis and returning that as an array of steps. We are actually already doing that in Linter today, which traverses with code path analysis and then flattens out that path into an array of steps. So I just moved that process from `Linter` into `SourceCode`...The big takeaway I've had so far is that it's modeled like Git branches. That bit of knowledge goes a long way towards understanding things better.  |

### Release

> @mdjermanovic: I think it's only eslint (including @eslint/js) this time.
> @nzakas There are other packages with release-please issues ready but they are just chores, so we can wait until we have something to actually ship

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will do the release
