## Topics

### [v8.0.0 status](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/projects/8)

#### [Update: Code path analysis for class fields (fixes #14343)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14886)

* @nzakas is merging a few of @mdjermanovic's suggestions, then this is done.

#### [Update rules to support ES2022 class fields](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14857)

* There are only a handful left to update, but @mdjermanovic wants to go through all the rules again to look for any class field scope or code path analysis changes.
* All agree that if we don't find out about a few rules that need to be updated until after the v8.0.0 final release, updating them in 8.1 or 8.2 is not a problem.

#### [[ESLint v8] Revert line comment directive support](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14960)

> @nzakas: This is related to using line comments for directives in addition to block comments, which has caused a bunch of pain from old comments that are now magically directives when they were not previously.
* @mdjermanovic, @nzakas, and @btmills are all in favor of reverting.
* The revert PR (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14973) is already up.

**Resolution**: Revert this change for now. We can revisit it later if we want to.

#### [Feature request: Expose `SourceCodeFixer`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14936)

* People were using `SourceCodeFixer` to do custom rule testing, but `SourceCodeFixer` is not part of the public API in v8.
* There was a separate request in the thread to support snapshot testing via custom assertions in `RuleTester`.
* The reported use case uses `SourceCodeFixer` to apply individual suggestions. @mdjermanovic left a [comment](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14936#issuecomment-905377189) to use the algorithm defined in the [`EditInfo` type](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api#-editinfo-type). Since that one-liner is available, @mdjermanovic believes this should not block v8.0.0.
* @nzakas and @btmills like that solution.
* @btmills asks how editor integrations apply suggestions since vscode-eslint does not appear to use `SourceCodeFixer` and could see exporting some API for that in the future.

**Resolution**: @mdjermanovic's suggestion is preferred, and we won't address this in v8.

### [Should `no-undef-init` apply to class fields?](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14857#issuecomment-906344741)

* @mdjermanovic left this question on the rule update thread, and we can discuss there.

### Contributor pool

* @nzakas nominates ota-meshi for updating vscode-eslint to support v8.0.0. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.
* @nzakas nominates JackNapis, stephenwade, and kepeniukas for assisting in #help. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.
* @mdjermanovic nominates timvdlippe for a new [`no-unused-private-class-members` rule](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14895). :+1: from @btmills and @nzakas.
* @nzakas proposes $300 for ota-meshi and $100 for everyone else. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.

**Resolution**: Award $300 to ota-meshi and $100 each to JackNapis, stephenwade, kepeniukas, and timvdlippe. @nzakas will contact them.

### [Scheduled release for August 27th, 2021](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14941)

* @mdjermanovic volunteers for the release.
* This will be another beta release.
* CI was already updated to use `npm install --force` in Node 16, but the Jenkins build script will also need it. @mdjermanovic added it.

### Ecosystem contributions

* After the last TSC meeting, @btmills reached out to the `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` team about supporting them, but they're not interested in joining Open Collective.
