## Topics

### [v8.0.0 status](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/projects/8)

* @mdjermanovic suggests adding another column between "Pull Request Opened" and "Done" for issues that are finished.
* @nzakas added a "Ready for Merge" column so we can sort issues that have approved pull requests.

#### [Add Support for Top-level await](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14632)

* @nzakas completed one final documentation change in the [Espree PR](https://github.com/eslint/espree/pull/505), which is ready for review.
* Rules should already handle top-level `await` thanks to changes like [#12571](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/commit/fed20bb039cf9f53adfcf93e467f418c5e958f45) that fixed support for other parsers like TypeScript and Babel.
* This issue will be resolved by a future PR that just upgrades Espree to v8.0.0.
* Once we merge the Espree PR, we can do a hopefully final beta and a final release the next week.

#### [Breaking: define an exports field for our public API](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13654)

* @mdjermanovic has approved the [corresponding PR](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14706).

* @mdjermanovic clarifies that this fix is still needed even though we're upgrading Ajv.

* @mdjermanovic will start reviewing it next week and let the team know what help is needed to finish it.
* The [`eslint-scope` PR](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/pull/69) on which it depends is just waiting for the final release of Espree, so that will be resolved quickly.

#### [Upgrade to Ajv version 8](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13888)

* [The PR](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/13911) is waiting for the new version of `ajv-draft-04`, some small corrections, and some testing.
* @mdjermanovic has no remaining open questions.
* Thanks to @mdjermanovic for keeping on top of this.

#### [Add Support for RegExp match indices](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14640)

* [The PR](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14653) is just waiting on the final Espree release. It should be an easy review.

### [Espree v8 `ecmaVersion` default conflicts with `RuleTester`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14710)

* RuleTester doesn't support `ecmaVersion: "latest"`
* If ecmaVersion isn't specified, rules that use `context.parserOptions` will get `ecmaVersion: 5` in runtime, but `ecmaVersion: undefined` when run through RuleTester.
* With Espree v8, all tests that don't have ecmaVersion specified will be parsed with the latest ecmaVersion.
* @nzakas suggests [reverting](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14711) the default change in Espree. We hoped it would be painless, but it's not worth keeping since it's causing problems.
* @btmills asks if after the revert we can still keep support for `ecmaVersion: "latest"` in Espree and ESLint.
* @nzakas confirms we can, though @mdjermanovic says `RuleTester` will still need to be fixed to support it. We can regroup to figure out details once we've reverted.
* :+1: from @nzakas, @btmills, and @mdjermanovic to merging [Revert "Update: ecmaVersion defaults to 5, and allows "latest" (#14622)"](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14711).

**Resolution**: We'll revert the original change, then we can use the Espree beta to try to support `ecmaVersion: "latest"` in ESLint.

### [Additional budget items](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/265#issuecomment-859751751)

* We've been pretty conservative so far, but some new sponsors recently enabled @nzakas to propose additional uses for the funds:

#### Eliminate team hour limits

* TSC members and Reviewers would be flat $60/hour without hour limits and no decreased rate for extra hours.
* Committers would be $30/hour also without hourly limits.
* :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.
* @nzakas previously had a couple concerns that led to the limits, but the decreased rate didn't actually prevent anyone from working, and removing the limits allows team members to scale up time when ready.
* @nzakas calls out that this would allow Committers to bill for their hours on their own, which we hadn't been doing.
* :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.

#### Increase contributor pool budget

* @nzakas proposes increasing the conributor pool budget from $500/month to $1,000/month.
* We've been allowing ourselves to award in excess of $500, so this formalizes that practice.
* :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.

#### Google Workspace

* Purchase a Google Workspace account to give the team access to emails at eslint.org, Google Docs, spreadsheets, mailing lists, etc.
* The cost will be $6/user/month.
* :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.
* @nzakas will get it set up.

#### Find other projects to sponsor

* @nzakas has already tried finding other dependencies to sponsor. Acorn declined to set up an OpenCollective after being offered sponsorship.
* @btmills is fine having budget allocated but unused until dependencies open up sponsorships.
* @nzakas increasing our existing budget from $500 to $1,000 so it's there when we need it.
* :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.
* @nzakas will update the issue accordingly.

#### Start sponsoring ecosystem projects

* This could include plugins, parsers, and other significant ecosystem projects.
* @btmills suggested typescript-eslint as one idea.
* @btmills feels these projects improve ESLint by adding support for frameworks we can't support in core and finding and fixing issues early.
* @nzakas suggests $500/month and seeing what happens. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.
* @btmills will create the budget item request in the team repository.

Remaining suggestions from the agenda are deferred to the next meeting.

### [Scheduled release for June 18th, 2021](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14682)

* @nzakas will wait for reviews on Espree PRs then do another beta release.

**Resolution**: @btmills will do the ESLint release.
