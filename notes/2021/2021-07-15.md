## Topics

### [Add `physicalFilename` option into rule tester](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14800)

**TSC Summary:** This issue requests to add a physicalFilename option to RuleTester to help with testing code blocks. There is already an RFC for enabling processors in RuleTester (https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/31) that may be more appropriate.

**TSC Question:** How do we want to proceed here?

* @mdjermanovic prefers to enable processors in `RuleTester` because all existing `RuleTester` options translate to `Linter` API options. The alternative of adding a `physicalFilename` option would require `Linter` to support it just for `RuleTester`. The RFC mentions a second use case that supporting processors in `RuleTester` would also enable.
* @nzakas feels implementing processors in `RuleTester` is a lot of work to pass a string into a test and wants to make sure we're making the right decision considering more than just the current API's constraints.
* @btmills agrees with @mdjermanovic and feels that for tests that expect a processor context, we're better off creating it for real with the RFC than giving another way to mimic it with a `physicalFilename` option.
* @nzakas defers to the group.
* @btmills volunteers to pick up the RFC.

**Resolution**: We'll implement processors in `RuleTester`, and @btmills will pick up the RFC.

### Sponsoring ecosystem projects

**TSC summary**: Above, Iâ€™ve identified several of the most widely-used ecosystem projects that accept sponsorships or that have maintainers who accept sponsorships.

**TSC question**: Which of these projects and maintainers, if any, do we want to sponsor, and how do we want to allocate our $500/mo budget among them?

> - [typescript-eslint](https://opencollective.com/typescript-eslint) ([chart](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=eslint&package=%40typescript-eslint%2Feslint-plugin&from=2020-06-25&to=2021-06-25)) is on Open Collective.
> - [ljharb](https://github.com/sponsors/ljharb) ([chart](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=eslint&package=eslint-plugin-import&package=eslint-plugin-react&package=eslint-config-airbnb&from=2020-06-25&to=2021-06-25)) maintains many plugins, including [`eslint-plugin-import`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import), [`eslint-plugin-react`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react), and [`eslint-config-airbnb`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
> - [`eslint-plugin-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) ([chart](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=eslint&package=eslint-plugin-prettier&from=2020-06-25&to=2021-06-25)) would be covered under the [Prettier](https://opencollective.com/prettier) Open Collective.
> - [`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) ([chart](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=eslint&package=eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y&from=2020-06-25&to=2021-06-25)) does not have a project sponsorship program, but the maintainer, [jessebeach](https://github.com/sponsors/jessebeach), does.
> - [`eslint-plugin-jest`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest) ([chart](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=eslint&package=eslint-plugin-jest&from=2020-06-25&to=2021-06-25)) does not have a project sponsorship program, but one of the maintainers, [G-Rath](https://github.com/sponsors/G-Rath), does.

* @nzakas notes that we can currently only donate through Open Collective. GitHub Sponsors requires a separate card. An Open Collective virtual card may be a workaround, but @nzakas would prefer to stick to Open Collective. @btmills is fine with that. The remaining options are typescript-eslint and eslint-plugin-prettier.
* @nzakas, @btmills, and @mdjermanovic are :+1: to typescript-eslint.
* @nzakas doesn't consider Prettier part of the ESLint ecosystem. @btmills is also less inclined toward the Prettier integration as a tangential part of the ecosystem but included it to be thorough.
* @nzakas suggests $100 for typescript-eslint and circling back for others later.
* @btmills offers to reach out to other plugins that do not yet have an Open Collective if we were willing to sponsor them should they join Open Collective.
* @nzakas suggests eslint-plugin-import and eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.
* @nzakas feels eslint-plugin-react should be supported by the React ecosystem so that ESLint isn't expected to support other framework-specific integrations as well. @btmills agrees.

**Resolution**: @nzakas will set up a $100/mo donation to typescript-eslint on Open Collective, and @btmills will reach out to eslint-plugin-import and eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y maintainers.

### [Breaking: Switch [eslint-scope] to ESM (fixes #70)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/pull/71)

**TSC Summary:** This PR switches eslint-scope to be an ESM package. We had originally planned on removing access to APIs under `lib/`, but that will break `@babel/eslint-parser`.

**TSC Question:** How shall we proceed?

> @nzakas: So I think we have to decide how to move forward, which I see as one of:
> 
> 1. "Bless" these APIs and just export them directly from this package.
> 2. Create a `use-at-your-own-risk` entrypoint like we did for ESLint that exports the things we don't want to officially support.
> 3. Keep all of the current APIs available at the current locations.

* @nzakas is in favor of option 1.
* @btmills asks about the compatibility guarantees we'd be making in that case.
* This would expose `Referencer`, `Visitor`, `Scope`, and `Definition`, and @nzakas doesn't see a downside to that.
* @btmills agrees and notes they're [already documented](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/scope-manager-interface).
* Since those APIs haven't ever changed significantly, @mdjermanovic doubts they will and supports exporting them.
* @nzakas summarizes that we agree to bless the APIs `@babel/eslint-parser` is using and export them. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.
* @btmills asks if we should remove the deprecated portions of those APIs.
* @nzakas prefers not to do it in this PR due to size.
* @mdjermanovic would rather consider it in the next major release since it could indirectly break ESLint rules depend on them. :+1: from @btmills and @nzakas.

**Resolution**: We'll export the APIs that `@babel/eslint-parser` needs without removing any deprecated APIs in this release.

### [v8.0.0 status](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/projects/8)

* @nzakas notes the syntax additions both depend on `eslint-scope`.

#### [--report-unused-disable-directives should be autofixable](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11815)

* The [PR](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14617) was recently updated.
* @mdjermanovic expects it to be done or nearly done.
* @btmills agrees.

#### [Allow all directives in line comments](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14575)

* The [PR](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14656) is ready.

#### [Breaking: disallow SourceCode#getComments() in RuleTester (refs #14744)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14769)

* This is ready.

#### [Breaking: upgrade espree and support new class features (fixes #14343)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14591)

* This is the big ESLint PR that implements new syntax support.
* It depends on `eslint-scope` changes being merged and released.
* @nzakas plans to focus on that next week, so we could optimistically do a prerelease in two weeks.

### Housekeeping

* @nzakas sent a TSC meeting invitation to our eslint.org email addresses. We can accept or decline to indicate attendance in advance.
* @nzakas also created a budget spreadsheet. Even with increased spending, donations still exceed expenses, and our balance should sustain us through donation fluctuations. Switching to Carbon Ads has doubled website revenue to ~$1,200/mo.
* @nzakas plans to write a blog post about our new pay structure, supporting other projects, and share the readonly budget spreadsheet when time permits.

### [Scheduled release for July 16th, 2021](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14770)

* `@eslint/eslintrc` had a bug fix and needs to be released and bumped first.

**Resolution**: @btmills will do the release.
