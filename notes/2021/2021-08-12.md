## Topics

### [Docs: Add v8.0.0 migration guide (fixes #14856)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14884)

**TSC Question**: do we want to promote eslint-plugin-eslint-plugin in the migration guide?

* @nzakas requested a review of the migration guide, which @btmills will do tonight.
* @bmish [suggested](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14884#discussion_r683793488) referencing a couple `eslint-plugin-eslint-plugin` rules to help plugin authors with the migration.
* We haven't referred people to third-party plugins previously, so this would establish new precedent.
* @btmills is fine with this as it's an optional tool that plugin authors could use to ease the migration.
* @nzakas didn't have a strong opinion.

**Resolution**: Include the suggestions for `eslint-plugin-eslint-plugin` rules.

### [`yield` is missing in `no-unsafe-finally`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14806)

**TSC Summary:** This proposal seeks to add a check for `yield` into `no-unsafe-finally`

**TSC Question:** shall we accept this proposal?

> @nzakas: I'm not sure if `yield` is unsafe in this situation. Unlike `break`, `continue`, `return`, and `throw`, `yield` doesn't actually exit the normal control flow of the function -- it just pauses and then picks up again after that. I'm not sure @hax's example is a problem, because it is the `break` statement that is preventing the second `console.log()` from firing.

* @btmills agrees with @nzakas because `yield` inside `finally` still functions like `yield` elsewhere in the function.
* @btmills can suggest a `no-restricted-syntax` pattern if we decline this proposal. :+1: from @nzakas.

**Resolution**: We will not add `yield` to `no-unsafe-finally`.

### [v8.0.0 status](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/projects/8)

* Last week, @nzakas merged all the semver-major PRs that were ready.

#### [Breaking: remove meta.docs.category in core rules (fixes #13398)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14594)

* This wasn't merged yet because it requires coordination with the website repository.
* @nzakas and @btmills agree it's not a blocker for the first beta release.

#### [Update: Code path analysis for class fields (fixes #14343)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14886)

* @nzakas managed to get code path analysis working with class fields but needs more eyes on the implementation.
* @btmills and @nzakas agree it's not required for the first beta release.

#### [Update rules to support ES2022 class fields](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14857)

* More than half of rules have been updated, which @nzakas feels is sufficient for a first beta. @btmills agrees.
* @mdjermanovic already found a handful of rules that didn't need to be updated and checked them off, so there may be more.

### [Scheduled release for August 13th, 2021](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14872)

* This will be the first v8.0.0 beta prerelease.
* The [Makefile](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/Makefile.js#L277) should automatically put the docs in a new `/8.0.0/` path to avoid overwriting the stable docs.

**Resolution**: @btmills will do a beta release solo and ping the team if something comes up.

### July contributor awards

* @nzakas nominates JackNapis, StephenWade, and kepeniukas for Discord help. :+1: from @btmills.
* @btmills nominates JoshuaKGoldberg for work to finish up [Breaking: Fixable disable directives (fixes #11815)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/14617). :+1: from @nzakas.
* @nzakas proposes $100 to each of the four. :+1: from @btmills.

**Resolution**: Award $100 each to JackNapis, StephenWade, kepeniukas, and JoshuaKGoldberg.

### Supporting ecosystem plugins

* [eslint-plugin-import](https://opencollective.com/eslint-plugin-import) and [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://opencollective.com/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) are now on Open Collective, and we're supporting them.
* @nzakas suggests reaching out to eslint-plugin-jsdoc about Open Collective so we can sponsor that project as well. :+1: from @btmills.

**Resolution**: @btmills will reach out to eslint-plugin-jsdoc maintainers about joining Open Collective.
