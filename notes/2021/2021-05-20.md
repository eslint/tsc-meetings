## Topics

### [v8.0.0 status](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/projects/8)

* @nzakas will update the RFC [Breaking: Strict package exports](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/80) to add a warranty-voiding `require("eslint/use-at-your-own-risk")` endpoint as an escape hatch for core rules and any other non-public APIs that the ecosystem depends on.
* @mdjermanovic plans to work on [Allow all directives in line comments](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14575) and [`fixable` property only necessary when `meta` is present](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13349) in the next week.
* The plan in [Upgrade to Ajv version 8](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13888) was updated recently so that is in theory a non-breaking change, in which case it would not need to be shipped as part of v8.0.0. @mdjermanovic has some concerns that it might still be a breaking change but will wait for the PR to see.

#### Espree class fields

* [Update: add class fields (refs eslint/eslint#14343)](https://github.com/eslint/espree/pull/486) is the last change before the next release of `espree`.
* Releasing `espree` then unblocks [the dependent `eslint-scope` PR](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/pull/69).
* @nzakas requested a status update and can finish the `espree` PR if @mysticatea doesn't have time.
* @mdjermanovic asks if we're trying to release class fields support before ESLint v8.0.0. @nzakas and @btmills had both been thinking we'd release it whenever it's ready rather than synchronizing it to v8.0.0.
* Since we're currently unable to release fixes for v7 after we start v8 pre-releases, @btmills suggests not merging class fields support into v7 if v8 is right around the corner in case something is broken.
* [One acorn change](https://github.com/eslint/espree/pull/456#issuecomment-729299535) might break plugins, so @mdjermanovic feels it's safer to bundle the `espree` upgrade with ESLint v8.
* @btmills, @mdjermanovic, and @nzakas are all in favor of upgrading Espree with class fields support as part of ESLint v8.0.0.

**Resolution**: Espree will be upgraded with class fields support as part of ESLint v8.0.0. @nzakas added it to the project board.

#### [Espree allow ecmaVersion: latest](https://github.com/eslint/espree/issues/495)

* @nzakas opened the issue, and @btmills and some other team members already left :+1:s on the issue.
* @mdjermanovic is generally :+1: but wants to think through some potential problems and will leave feedback by Monday.

#### [New: Fixable Disable Directives](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/78)

* @mdjermanovic understood this was originally intended to be opt-in. Per the RFC, it's enabled whenever `--fix` and `--report-unused-disable-directives` are enabled.
* @nzakas believes this is the most logical way for the feature to work so that whatever can be reported can be also be fixed by `--fix`.
* The RFC has been in final commenting for more than 7 days, so @nzakas intends to merge it. :+1: from @btmills and @mdjermanovic.

### Add "Feedback Needed" column to Triage board

* @nzakas has observed issues stuck in "Evaluating" and suggests adding a new "Feedback Needed" column to request further feedback from the team.
* "Evaluating" would be used when a maintainer is still making progress, so other team members only need to jump in if they're interested. "Feedback Needed" would be used when the maintainer has gotten as far as they can unilaterally and needs input from the rest of the team.
* :+1: from @btmills and @nzakas.

**Resolution**: @nzakas will add a "Feedback Needed" column to the Triage board.

### [Scheduled release for May 21st, 2021](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14584)

**Resolution**: @mdjermanovic will do the release.
