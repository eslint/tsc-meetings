## Topics

### [Minimum browser versions for website support](https://github.com/eslint/website/issues/543)

* Right now the website's demo doesn't work in IE 11, but it makes up 0.72% of our visits.
* Making it work in IE 11 does not seem trivial.
* @btmills suggests supporting IE 11 in static docs but not for the demo. :+1: from @ilyavolodin and @mysticatea.

**Resolution**: The website will support IE 11, but the demo will not.

### [Add CodeTriage badge to eslint/eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/11807)

* Discussion remains shelved until we have more information.

### [Support TypeScript in configuration initializer](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11789)

* @mysticatea, @btmills, and @platinumazure all left :+1:s on the issue.
* @ilyavolodin is :-1: and would rather allow plugins to extend configuration presets than be in a position to decide what meets the bar.
* @btmills is :+1:, agreeing with @ilyavolodin that allowing plugins to provide presets would be good but wanting to make an exception in the meantime given the initiative to support TypeScript.
* @mysticatea is :+1: because we have declared that we welcome TypeScript support on our blog.

**Resolution**: Include a built-in TypeScript config preset and look into allowing plugins to provide additional init presets in the future.

### [Scheduled release for August 16th, 2019](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12072)

* Nobody in the meeting could make schedules match, so we'll figure out a time offline.
