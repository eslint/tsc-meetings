## Topics

### [New: Recoverable Error Handling](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/134#issuecomment-499588193)

**TSC Summary:** [README.md](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/blob/handling-recoverable-errors/designs/2019-recoverable-error-handling/README.md)

* @platinumazure suggested using a loose parsing mode in a [pull request review](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/11509#pullrequestreview-220174854).
* @mysticatea has implemented recoverable errors in `vue-eslint-parser`, and TypeScript has recoverable errors as well.
* We should try to avoid cases where additional errors and potential false positives due to invalid AST could confuse users or introduce additional complexity.
* @btmills suggests showing as many parser errors as we can but only running lint rules once the parser passes successfully.
* @platinumazure suggests adding an option to `parserOptions` that would error immediately like the current behavior, show all parser errors, or show all recoverable errors and run lint rules.
* :+1: to showing all recoverable errors at once from @btmills, @kaicataldo, @ilyavolodin, @mysticatea, @platinumazure. Details to be decided in the RFC.
* Though this could technically show more errors at one time, it will not show any errors where there weren't any already, so this does not have to be a breaking change. @btmills, @kaicataldo, and @platinumazure agree. Nobody against.

**Resolution**: @mysticatea will update the RFC to show all recoverable errors at once by default.

### [Scheduled release for June 7th, 2019](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11768)

**Resolution**: @platinumazure and @ilyavolodin will do the release.
