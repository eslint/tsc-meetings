### [chore: add pkg.type "commonjs"](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19011)

Should we merge this PR?

**Resolution:** merge approved

### [Expose acorn plugin from espree module](https://github.com/eslint/js/issues/623)

> @nzakas: This asks to expose the Acorn plugin from Espree. While I'm not in favor of exposing it via the espree package, I'm starting to think it could be beneficial to expose it through another package.

> Basically, as a toolkit for people who want to customize Acorn and still have it usable through ESLint.

> I ran into this experimenting with a TypeScript Acorn plugin, where I ended up needing to re-implement a lot of the fixes that Espree does to the AST. 

**Resolution:** team is generally in favor and will follow up on this.

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will look at the details over the weekend

### [Change Request: Create supported versions policy](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18621)

**Resolution:** Issue has been closed.

### Scheduled release for October 18th, 2024
