## Topics

### [v9.0.0](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/4/views/2)

#### [Bug: Incorrect code path analysis for return in try blocks with catch clause](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17579)

**Resolution:** this issue will not block `beta.0` and we will target `beta.1` instead.

#### [Docs: Show v9.0.0-alpha.0 in dropdown instead of NEXT](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17943)

**Resolution:** moving to `beta.1`.

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will open a separate issue to come up with a long term solution.

#### [Change Request: Always check data for message in rule tester](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18016)

**Resolution:** we will target to release on `beta.0` could possibly move to `beta.1`.

#### [Change Request: Add API for integrators to easily swap between flat config and eslintrc APIs](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18075)

**Resolution:**

- We will also add a configType static property to the ESLint and LegacyESLint constructors to indicate the config type it uses.
- We will need to backport the changes to the v8.x branch so loadESLint() is also available there. That will end up being a slightly different implementation.

**Action Items:**

- @nzakas will create a new PR based off of [#18075](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18075)

#### [Change Request: Flat Config does not support FileEnumerator](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18087)

**TSC Summary:** this looks like something ESLint was not previously intended to support; we can't do a final v9 until we've solved this problem since `eslint-plugin-import` is one of the most depended on packages on npm.

**Action Items:** @nzakas and @mdjermanovic will follow up on this issue.
