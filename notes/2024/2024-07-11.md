## Topics

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:**  working on the [version support page](https://github.com/eslint/eslint.org/pull/600), the [alternate config loading approach](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/120), and the `@eslint/json` package.

* **@mdjermanovic:** reviewing PRs and RFCs, and fixed several bugs in `eslint`, `eslint-scope` and `eslint/compat`

* **@fasttime:** worked on upgrading `@types/eslint`, apart from that I reviewed issues and RFCs.

### Code Explorer

Code Explorer is nearing completion. Hayden showed @nzakas a demo and it's looking really good. Just a few rough edges to sand down and hopefully we'll get that pushed to GitHub next week. Ideally, we'd  announce the release of Code Explorer with the availability of `@eslint/json`, as Code Explorer can also show JSON ASTs.
