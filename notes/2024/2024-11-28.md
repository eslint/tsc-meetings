### [perf: Fix caching in config loaders](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19042)

We had an action item from the meeting before the previous one, to compare performances starting from ESLint `v9.11.1`. @mdjermanovic did some performance comparisons from ESLint `v9.11.1` to `v9.15.0`, on Node.js `v22.11.0`. Some observations: 

* Per the "Multiple Individual Files" test made for that PR, the config caching problem introduced in `v9.12.0` has been fixed in `v9.14.0`.
* Interestingly, on the other hand, all of our standard performance tests, which are Loading, Single File (one big file), and Multi Files (450 files matched by a glob) show notable performance improvements in `v9.12.0`. This was unexpected, but welcome ðŸ™‚
* Surprisingly, the effects of Node.js compile cache, enabled in ESLint `v9.13.0`, aren't noticeable in test results.
* There seems to be a small but noticeable degradation in Loading and Multiple Individual Files tests in `v9.15.0`

**Action Items:**

- @mdjermanovic will repeat the tests to double check and the will post the results in the same issue.
