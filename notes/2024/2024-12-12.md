## Transcript

[`2024-12-12-transcript.md`](2024-12-12-transcript.md)

## Attending

- Nicholas C. Zakas (@nzakas) - TSC
- Francesco Trotta (@fasttime) - TSC

@nzakas moderated, and @sam3k took notes.

## Topics

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** has been working on the JSON plugin, the CSS plugin, and the extends RFC
* **@fasttime:** has made good progress on my RFC for multithread linting and should be able to post a draft this weekend. Other than that, just the usual work triaging and reviewing issue


### Holiday Schedule

We will skip both; the TSC meeting on December 26th as well as the December 27th release and resume the TSC meeting on January 9th and releases on January 10th

### When do we want to mark `eslint.config.ts` as stable? 

* It seems like everything has gone pretty smoothly
* We have not heard any complaints about TS config files

**Action Items:** @fasttime will open an issue/PR to move the flag to inactive and enable TypeScript config files by default.


### When should we mark the alternate config lookup algorithm as stable?

* we'd create a new flag starting with `v10_` and move the old flag to inactive
* we still have [an issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18948) with alternate config lookup

**Resolution:** we won't mark as stable until the pending issue is fixed


### [Change Request: Provide a better system than "extension" rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19173)

Wrapping rules is not a supported use case and plugin developers are on their own if they decide to do so. We are willing to give core rules knowledge of TypeScript syntax to eliminate the need for some of the typescript-eslint rules that just wrap core rules with knowledge of TS syntax, but that's about as far as we'd want to go regarding this issue.

**Resolution:** we will leave the issue open so we can track the effort back to this original request and when it's closed we can know it's done for good

## RFC Duty

* December 16: @fasttime
