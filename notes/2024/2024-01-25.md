## Topics

### [Rule Change: Change default for no-unused-var's caughtErrors option to "all"](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17974)

**TSC Summary:** This issue seeks to change the default value of caughtErrors on no-unused-vars to "all". It's currently "none".

**TSC Question:** Do we want to change this option's default value?

**Resolution:** we've agreed to change the default of caughtErrors to "all".

### [Request: backporting flat config bug fixes to v8](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17966)

**TSC Summary:** We've made several bug fixes to flat config in the v9 branch that aren't in the v8 branch, which makes it difficult for plugins to support both v8 and v9 at the same time. This issue requests backporting those changes into v8 and then doing one last release in v8. At the moment, we don't have a way to release from any branch other than main, and we generate other artifacts (docs, release notes, blog posts) that all assume on branch.

**TSC Question:** Do we want to backport flat config fixes into v8? If so, how can we go about this in the least disruptive way possible?

**Resolution:** we've decided to:

- Do a backport release for the flat config changes
- The backport v8.x release will happen prior to the final v9.0.0 release
- We've agreed to publish to the `latest` tag
- The branch should be named `v8.x`

_Pending technical investigation._

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will investigate.
