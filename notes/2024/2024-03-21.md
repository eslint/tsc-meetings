## Topics

### [v9.0.0](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/4/views/2)

#### [feat!: move AST traversal into SourceCode](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/18167)

**Resolution:** We've agreed to merge the changes and revisit any rule updates afterwards.

#### [Bug: Incorrect code path analysis for return in try blocks with catch clause](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17579)

**Status:** @fasttime suggested moving to v10 as this will take some time.

**Resolution:** Moving to v10 so we have time to dig in.

#### [feat: support the new flat config](https://github.com/eslint/create-config/issues/51)

**Status:** @fasttime has been reviewing this the few last days and it looks good now. There are just of couple of questions he's not 100% sure about.

**Action Items:** @nzakas will take a look at outstanding questions.

#### [Switch Playground to flat config](https://github.com/eslint/eslint.org/issues/507)

**Status:** There are a few things to address. Looks like @snitin315 will be away for some time so I could take over the PR to finish if he can't at the moment.

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will drive this to completion.

### Scheduled release for March 22nd, 2024

**Action Items:**

- @fasttime will release the following:

  - `eslint` (rc.0)
  - `eslint/js`
  - `eslint-scope`

- @mdjermanovic will work on a proposal to change `release-please` so it avoids generating releases if commits do not affect users
