### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** has been working on the CSS plugin and adding concurrency for the `readFile` retrier.
* **@mdjermanovic:** has been working on config loader caching, new syntax, and spent a lot of time reviewing the `meta.defaultOptions` PR as it updates the core and 70+ rules.
* **@fasttime:** did the release, completed https://github.com/eslint/rewrite/pull/59 and continued working on fixing drive letter handing on Windows in ESLint. Also did some repo maintenance to fix the build and updated dependencies.


### RFC Duty Schedule

* October 28: @mdjermanovic
* November 4: @fasttime 
* November 11: @Nicholas C. Zakas 
* November 18: @mdjermanovic

### [feat: CSS language plugin](https://github.com/eslint/css/pull/2)

This PR is ready for review

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will take a look


### [Bug: require-atomic-updates false negative when accessing `this`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19022)

It seems that this is excepted from the rule, and the question is whether or not that should be the case. If not, should it be a change of default or a new option? This is a valid request. But given that the way this rule works with properties is "controversial" (there were many reports for false positives) and the complexity required to support `this` (as it's not handled by scope manager) we're 50/50 on `accepting/wontfix`. If we do accept, it should be behind an option.

**Resolution:**  we've decided to close as wontfix.

- @ota-meshi: $500 for eslint/js#639
- @LiviaMedeiros: $100 for eslint/eslint#19035
- @MikeMcC399: $100 for eslint/generator-eslint#194
- @aryaemami59: $100 for eslint/eslint#18954


### Scheduled release for November 1st, 2024

**Action Items:**

- @mdjermanovic will release:
  - `eslint`
  - `@eslint/js`
  - `@eslint/json`
  - `@eslint/create-config`

### Benchmark Runtime of `v9.12.0` to `v9.14.0`

After the release, I think it would be helpful to compare the runtime of v9.12.0 to v9.14.0 since we'll have implemented two perf improvements (compile cache and config array caching).

**Action Items:**

* folks should compare runtime between these two versions and report back with findings
* @mdjermanovic will ask in [this issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19025) whether they notice better performance with `9.14.0`
