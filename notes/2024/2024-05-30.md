## Topics

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** I've spent most of my time split across two things: the `migrate-config` utility and the refactor that splits out the JavaScript-specific functionality to move us towards language plugins
* **@mdjermanovic:** Mostly reviewing PRs (some big ones) and triaging issues. I also fixed a couple of bugs and updated release-please config in all repos. Outside eslint org, I submitted a PR to eslint-plugin-react to support eslint v9.
* **@fasttime:** Okay, I've been mostly doing triaging and code review, and I've worked on `getConfigStatus` in the config-array [package](https://github.com/eslint/rewrite/pull/7) and taking care of the RFCs of course
