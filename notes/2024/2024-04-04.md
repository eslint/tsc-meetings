## Topics

### Status of previous actionable items

- [x] [feat: support the new flat config](https://github.com/eslint/create-config/issues/51) (Completed)
- [x] [Switch Playground to flat config](https://github.com/eslint/eslint.org/issues/507) (Completed)

### [Change Request: `--inspect-config` CLI option](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18255)

**TSC Summary:** This issue seeks to add a --inspect-config CLI option that will launch the config inspector (similar to --init does with @eslint/create-config).

**TSC Question:** Shall we accept this proposal?

**Resolution:** We've agreed to accept this proposal

**Action Items:** @nzakas will work on the PR

### [feat: Support different names for code block languages](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-plugin-markdown/issues/245)

**TSC Summary:** This change seeks to use recognizable filename extensions for common code block types like node, javascript, ecmascript to .js, markdown to .md, and typescript to .ts. Currently, the plugin would use the code block type as the filename extension, so javascript becomes 0.javascript, which is a bit confusing.

**TSC Question:** This represents a breaking change, do we want to accept this and publish a new major version?

**Resolution:** We've agreed to accept this proposal but will omit `node` option at this time.

### [Change Request: Provide a way for rules to apply suggestions to other files](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17881)

**TSC Summary:** This issue requests to formalize the ability of ESLint rules to make changes to files other than the file currently being linted. This can happen when a plugin is managing a separate file, such as eslint-plugin-expect-type, which generates type information and stores it in a snapshot file.

**TSC Question:** Is this something we want to explore?

**Resolution:** We've decided to table the discussion until we have time to review it

**Action Items:** @mdjermanovic will review it

### [Change Request: Consider also moving slightly-more-than-formatting rules out of core](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17681)

**TSC Summary:** This issue seeks to deprecate two additional rules, multiline-comment-style and line-comment-position, and allow @stylistic to take over maintenance in the plugin.

**TSC Question:** Shall we do so?

**Resolution:** We've decided to deprecate these two rules and coordinate with `eslint-stylistic` to incorporate and maintain them going forward.

### [v9.0.0](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/projects/4/views/2)
